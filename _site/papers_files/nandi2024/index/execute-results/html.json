The provision of childcare has the potential to improve women’s mental health, but evidence on the effects of providing access to daycare is limited. Methods We designed a cluster-randomised trial and used data from a sample of 2858 mothers with age-eligible children from 160 village hamlets in rural Rajasthan, India, to evaluate the impact of providing access to a community-based daycare programme on social and emotional aspects of women’s mental health. We conducted a baseline survey in early 2016, randomised hamlets to intervention or control groups approximately six months later, and delivered the final post-intervention survey approximately two years thereafter. Results Treatment assignment increased the probability that a respondent used a daycare over the two-year follow-up by 40.9 percentage points. Providing randomised access to a daycare resulted in 0.2 (95\\% confidence interval (CI)\\, = \\,−0.1, 0.4) fewer symptoms of mental distress, representing a 9.5\\% decline compared to the baseline mean of 2.1 symptoms, as well as a 3.7 (95\\% CI\\, = \\,−0.8, 8.3) percentage point increase in the proportion of women who reported feeling very happy, equivalent to an 11.0\\% increase relative to the baseline mean of 33.6\\%. Among social indicators, treatment assignment was associated with a 5.6 (95\\% CI\\, = \\,−1.2, 12.4) percentage point increase in membership in an association, a relative increase of 43.4\\% compared to the baseline mean of 12.9\\%. The intervention did not have an appreciable impact on measures of life satisfaction or trust in institutions. Two-stage least squares instrumental variable analyses showed that daycare use decreased mental distress by 0.4 (95\\% CI\\, = \\,−0.1, 0.8) symptoms, increased the proportion of women who were very happy by 9.4 (95\\% CI\\, = \\,0.0, 17.6) percentage points, and increased membership in an organisation by 15.9 (95\\% CI\\, = \\,8.4, 23.7) percentage points. Conclusions The provision of affordable, community-based daycare was associated with substantial uptake and showed potential for improving mothers’ mental health in a rural context where most women were not employed in the formal labour force.
