In the sidebar are links to detailed descriptions of current courses.\nTeaching at McGill Presently I teach two courses at McGill: a new PhD-level seminar focused on current substantive and methodological issues in epidemiology, and a course on Impact Evaluation, which I have been co-teaching with Arijit Nandi since 2016.\nEPIB 706 EPIB 706 is a PhD-level seminar aimed at providing space for students to engage with overarching concepts critical to the theory and practice of epidemiology, as well to explore recent controversies and debates in the field. This course is designed to reinforce formal coursework through making space to develop and sharpen critical thinking skills. We review a selection of papers that range across methods, principles, arguments, and debates in epidemiology and the wider scientific community.\nPPHS 617 This course covers methods for estimating the effects of social interventions on health outcomes. We introduce and provide the intuition for conducting impact evaluation studies in public and population health and discuss recent methodological developments. We define causal policy effects within the potential outcomes framework and contrast methods for describing associations between an intervention and health outcome with methods for estimating causal effects. We introduce and formally define policy-relevant research questions based on specific causal contrasts. The course format is a mixture of didactic lectures, classroom evaluations of published evaluations, homework assignments, and student presentations. We introduce students to approaches for estimating the effects of social interventions, classified broadly as experimental or observational (quasi-experimental). The section on experimental research covers the use of randomized trials and cluster randomized trials for impact evaluation. The section on observational designs will describe quasi-experimental techniques, including interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs.\nTeaching at Erasmus University (to come)\nTeaching at University of Copenhagen (to come)\n","date":1599609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1599609600,"objectID":"6dca12325620864ee41de721cd830105","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/courses/mcgill/","publishdate":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mcgill/","section":"courses","summary":"Descriptions of what I teach and where.","tags":null,"title":"Teaching Summary","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course Description EPIB 706 is a PhD-level seminar aimed at providing space for students to engage with overarching concepts critical to the theory and practice of epidemiology, as well to explore recent controversies and debates in the field. The purpose of this course is not to equip you with any marketable skill; rather, it is to reinforce your formal coursework by making space to develop and sharpen your critical thinking skills. We will review a selection of papers that range across methods, principles, arguments, and debates in epidemiology and the wider scientific community.\nEligibility Registration in the PhD program in Epidemiology and successful completion of the course sequence in epidemiologic methods (EPIB 704 and EPIB 705) is required. Students who have not completed EPIB 704 and EPIB 705 must obtain the instructor\u0026rsquo;s permission to take the course.\nCourse Format This is a discussion-based course and this year, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it will be held remotely until further notice. We are all here to learn from one another, and this course simply won\u0026rsquo;t work without engagement and participation from all of us (including me). Of course, everyone has their own level of comfort speaking up, as well as varying levels of interest in some of these topics, so I have no expectation that everyone participates equally. What I do ask is that you make a sincere effort to engage with the material, both in terms of the reading and in the discussion forum. Learning how to respectfully express your opinion about conceptual and methodological issues is a core part of being a scientist.\nEvaluation Written Assignments The discussions in the course are meant to activate your critical thinking skills, and to encourage you to synthesize your own thoughts on the material, particularly as it may relate to your area of research interest. Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit two critical essays that explore a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science.These may be direct responses to material that we read or discuss in class, or they may be essays exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate good-faith efforts to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 1500 words. The first one is due on October 22, 2020 and the second one is due on December 7, 2020. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to.\nClass Participation In addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead one day of discussion among the topics that we will cover. For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic.\nGrading The course is pass-fail.\nReading The assigned readings are the core of the course material, and students are expected to carefully and critically read each assignment before class. To facilitate student engagement with the reading we will use the online tool Perusall for all required readings. Perusall is a reading platform in which students annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available here (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content \u0026gt; Perusall (readings) \u0026gt; Perusall, and then click the \u0026ldquo;Open Link\u0026rdquo; button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall\u0026rsquo;s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion.\nA Note About Class Participation Participation means showing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion in Perusall, and bring those to class. During the discussion period in class participation means asking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable, offering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class.\nCourse Outline (12 \u0026ldquo;questions\u0026rdquo; to consider) A note about the outline. In an effort to make this course as dynamic and helpful to students as possible, the list of topics and reading below is subject to change. Enthusiasm (or lack thereof) for certain topics may lead us to revise, drop, add, or replace some readings or entire topics as we go. I promise to entertain any changes or suggestions, but may also disagree if I feel certain topics or readings are too important to replace.\nWeek 1: Course introduction  Administrative aspects of the course.

We will introduce and provide the intuition for conducting impact evaluation studies in public and population health and discuss recent developments. We will define causal policy effects within the potential outcomes framework and contrast methods for describing the association between an intervention and health outcome with methods for estimating causal effects. We will introduce and formally define policy-relevant research questions based on specific causal contrasts. The course format will be a mixture of didactic lectures, classroom evaluations of published evaluations, homework assignments, and student presentations. In the lecture component of the class, we will introduce approaches for estimating the effects of social interventions, classified broadly as experimental or observational (quasi-experimental). The section on experimental research will cover the use of randomized trials and cluster randomized trials for impact evaluation. The section on observational designs will describe quasi-experimental techniques, including interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, synthetic control, and regression discontinuity designs.\nReference text There is no required text. Readings will be assigned. Several readings will be assigned from Impact Evaluation in Practice (2nd Edition), which is downloadable from: http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/sief-trust-fund/publication/impact-evaluation-in-practice\nCourse format The course will be a combination of didactic lectures, practicums, presentations, and roundtable sessions. The reading load will be substantial, as we are trying to expose you to a wide variety of the diverse set of conceptual and methodological issues relevant for impact evaluation.\nAssessment Attendance/participation: 20% Course attendance is mandatory. Your grade will be based on participation in general class activities, practicums, discussions of readings, and debate. Part of your participation will depend on your preparation. This means showing up for each class having completed the assigned readings; this is especially true for practicum sessions—it is expected that students will begin the practicum assignments, including any readings, in advance of the session. In class, participation means asking questions about anything in the readings, lectures or discussion that seems unclear or objectionable, offering arguments and responses, respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others, and generally being a good citizen.\nStudent protocol and presentation: 50% (40% for written protocol and 10% for presentation) Over the course of the term students will work in groups of 2-3 students to develop a protocol for a pragmatic intervention study and evaluation. For this project you will work with your group to develop an impact evaluation study designed to estimate the effect of a public policy intervention on a health-related outcome. You should draw on the course material and apply one of the evaluation methods covered. The design of your evaluation should be original, meaning the intervention or the evaluation method must be novel; you cannot replicate an existing impact evaluation (simply changing the outcomes in an existing evaluation study is not sufficient). For the written component of the protocol, each group will submit an evaluation protocol using guidelines that will be provided. Only one submission is allowed per group and we expect partners to contribute equally to the project. Each student will also participate in a short group presentation of their protocol, and will answer questions from their peers and the instructors. Students will be evaluated on their ability to demonstrate mastery of the core conceptual and methodological material presented in class, and on their ability to communicate their ideas and respond to critiques of their work.\nHomework assignments: 30% Advanced statistical techniques and their assumptions can become clearer with hands-on experience and practice. We aim to provide experience and practice by giving two homework assignments during the term that will involve data analysis and interpretation of results. You can use any software package to complete the assignments. We will provide technical support as best we can. You are allowed to work in groups of up to three, with one submission per group.\nDetailed course outline Readings and additional resources for each session will be posted on the course website: https://piazza.com/mcgill.ca/winter2020/pphs617/home\nIntroduction 6 Jan: Lecture 1.

We sought to determine if fetuses with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids had increased rates of prescriptions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication in childhood, using a quasiexperimental design that better controls for confounding than existing observational studies. METHODS: We identified 16 358 children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery between 31 + 0 (31 weeks, 0 days) and 36 + 6 weeks' gestation in 2000-2013, using a perinatal data registry from British Columbia, Canada, and linked their records with population-based child ADHD medication data (2000-2018). We used a regression discontinuity design to capitalize on the fact that pregnancies presenting for delivery immediately before and immediately after the clinical cut-off for antenatal corticosteroid administration of 34 + 0 weeks' gestation have very different levels of exposure to corticosteroids, but are otherwise similar with respect to confounders. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 9 years, 892 (5.5%) children had 1 or more dispensations of ADHD medication. Children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery just before the corticosteroid clinical cut-off of 34 + 0 weeks' gestation did not appear to be more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication than those admitted just after the cut-off (rate ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 1.6; 1.3 excess cases per 100 children, 95% CI -2.5 to 5.7). INTERPRETATION: We found little evidence that children with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids have higher rates of ADHD prescriptions in childhood, supporting the safety of antenatal corticosteroids for this neurodevelopmental outcome.","tags":["regression discontinuity","antenatal steroids","ADHD","childhood"],"title":"Antenatal corticosteroid administration and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in childhood: a regression discontinuity study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mabel Carabali","Sam Harper","Antonio S Lima Neto","Geziel Dos Santos de Sousa","Andrea Caprara","Berta Nelly Restrepo","Jay S Kaufman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645639227,"objectID":"1e2ef090030a1ee788089924b11c713c","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/carabali-2022-wh/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T18:00:27.313767Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carabali-2022-wh/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: We used surveillance data from Brazil and Colombia during 2007-2017 to assess the presence of socioeconomic inequalities on dengue, chikungunya and Zika at the neighborhood level in two Latin American cities. METHODS: To quantify the inequality, we estimated and decomposed the relative concentration index of inequality (RCI) accounting for the spatiotemporal distribution of the diseases. RESULTS: There were 281 426 arboviral cases notified in Fortaleza, Brazil, and 40 889 in Medellin, Colombia. The RCI indicated greater concentration of dengue cases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIs for chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during their introduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellin indicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI decomposition showed that year of notification and age were the main contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5% of the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age, presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants of the heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomic spectrum.","tags":["Arboviruses","Brazil","Collective Effects of Health Disparities","Colombia","Decomposition of Inequalities","Latin America"],"title":"Decomposition of socioeconomic inequalities in arboviral diseases in Brazil and Colombia (2007-2017)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer A Hutcheon","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645639227,"objectID":"785264eb8f980c6a3fda126dff1788cd","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/hutcheon-2021-wk/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T18:00:27.142493Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hutcheon-2021-wk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"No, it is not too good to be true: Response by Hutcheon and Harper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer A Hutcheon","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645639226,"objectID":"2a225c25e6c312f08dcf7583c1258bd5","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/hutcheon-2021-wt/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T18:00:26.772132Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hutcheon-2021-wt/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is: Conducting within-woman comparison studies with only one exposure observation per woman","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eva Graham","Tristan Watson","Sonya S Deschênes","Kristian B Filion","Mélanie Henderson","Sam Harper","Laura C Rosella","Norbert Schmitz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645639227,"objectID":"552fe8c2d35bb50c2f24548a9b8fe37e","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/graham-2021-wh/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T18:00:26.961539Z","relpermalink":"/publication/graham-2021-wh/","section":"publication","summary":"This cohort study aimed to compare the incidence of type 2 diabetes in adults with depression-related weight gain, depression-related weight loss, depression with no weight change, and no depression.

The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.","tags":["cardiovascular diseases","health inequalities","homicide","life expectancy","opioids","suicide"],"title":"Declining Life Expectancy in the United States: Missing the Trees for the Forest","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Deepa Jahagirdar","Michelle Dimitris","Erin Strumpf","Jay S Kaufman","Sam Harper","Jody Heymann","Efe Atabay","Ilona Vincent","Arijit Nandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646149027,"objectID":"27fc07136648c49de91a65602efe068e","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/jahagirdar-2021-ww/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T15:37:07.087881Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jahagirdar-2021-ww/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Balancing work and care: the effect of paid adult medical leave policies on employment in Europe","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer A Hutcheon","Sam Harper","Jessica Liauw","M Amada Skoll","Myriam Srour","Erin C.

However, there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among primary school children in India. METHODS: We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey. Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at least 12 months old at baseline in 2004-2005. In 2011-2012, the same children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included 33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as well as state fixed effects. RESULTS: Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54% were fully vaccinated at baseline, and 54% could read by the age of 8-11 years. The estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4 to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6% to 12%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the treatment and outcome. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting effects on children's learning achievements. Further work is needed to confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to educational outcomes.","tags":["child health","employment","epidemiology","inequalities","multilevel modelling","policy","psychosocial factors","social epidemiology","social inequalities","socioeconomic"],"title":"Effect of vaccination on children's learning achievements: findings from the India Human Development Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mira Johri","Dinesh Chandra","Karna Georges Kone","Marie-Pierre Sylvestre","Alok K Mathur","Sam Harper","Arijit Nandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039258,"objectID":"19a71745292ff36708106812719287af","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/johri-2020-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:38.196847Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johri-2020-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: In resource-poor settings, lack of awareness and low demand for services constitute important barriers to expanding the coverage of effective interventions. In India, childhood immunization is a priority health strategy with suboptimal uptake. OBJECTIVE: To assess study feasibility and key implementation outcomes for the Tika Vaani model, a new approach to educate and empower beneficiaries to improve immunization and child health. METHODS: A cluster-randomized pilot trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, from January to September 2018. Villages were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. In each participating village, surveyors conducted a complete enumeration to identify eligible households and requested participation before randomization. Interventions were designed through formative research using a social marketing approach and delivered over 3 months using strategies adapted to disadvantaged populations: (1) mobile health (mHealth): entertaining educational audio capsules (edutainment) and voice immunization reminders via mobile phone and (2) face-to-face: community mobilization activities, including 3 small group meetings offered to each participant. The control group received usual services. The main outcomes were prespecified criteria for feasibility of the main study (recruitment, randomization, retention, contamination, and adoption). Secondary endpoints tested equity of coverage and changes in intermediate outcomes. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics to assess feasibility, penalized logistic regression and ordered logistic regression to assess coverage, and generalized estimating equation models to assess changes in intermediate outcomes. RESULTS: All villages consented to participate. Gaps in administrative data hampered recruitment; 14.0% (79/565) of recorded households were nonresident. Only 1.4% (8/565) of households did not consent. A total of 387 households (184 intervention and 203 control) with children aged 0 to 12 months in 26 villages (13 intervention and 13 control) were included and randomized. The end line survey occurred during the flood season; 17.6% (68/387) of the households were absent. Contamination was less than 1%. Participation in one or more interventions was 94.0% (173/184), 78.3% (144/184) for the face-to-face strategy, and 67.4% (124/184) for the mHealth strategy. Determinants including place of residence, mobile phone access, education, and female empowerment shaped intervention use; factors operated differently for face-to-face and mHealth strategies. For 11 of 13 intermediate outcomes, regression results showed significantly higher basic health knowledge among the intervention group, supporting hypothesized causal mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: A future trial of a new intervention model is feasible. The interventions could strengthen the delivery of immunization and universal primary health care. Social and behavior change communication via mobile phones proved viable and contributed to standardization and scalability. Face-to-face interactions remain necessary to achieve equity and reach, suggesting the need for ongoing health system strengthening to accompany the introduction of communication technologies.

We estimated the effect of water availability on suicide in rural India, a context where the majority of households are dependent upon agriculture. METHODS: We used data from a nationally representative sample of 8.5 million people who were monitored for causes of death from 2001 to 2013. Water availability was measured with high-resolution precipitation and temperature data (i.e., the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index). We used a fixed effects approach that modeled changes in water availability within districts (n = 569) over time (n = 13 years) to estimate the impact on suicide deaths. We restricted our analysis to rural areas and to deaths occurring during the growing season (June-March) among adults aged 15 or older, and controlled for sex, age, region, and year. We used Poisson regression with standard errors clustered at the district level and total deaths as the offset. RESULTS: There were 9456 suicides and 249,786 total deaths in our study population between 2001 and 2013. Compared to normal growing seasons, the percent of deaths due to suicide increased by 18.7% during extremely wet growing seasons (95% CI: 6.2, 31.2) and by 3.6% during extremely dry growing seasons (95% CI: -17.9, 25.0). We found that effects varied by age. CONCLUSIONS: We found extremes is water availability associated with an increase in suicide. Abnormally wet growing conditions may play an important, yet overlooked, role in suicide among rural Indian adults.","tags":["drought","India","million deaths study","standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index","suicide"],"title":"Extremes in water availability and suicide: Evidence from a nationally representative sample of rural Indian adults","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashley Nunes","Sam Harper","Kristen D Hernandez"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039257,"objectID":"f507477f0a727bb8374e19d4b53b5d96","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/nunes-2020-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:37.364735Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nunes-2020-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Price Isn't Right: Autonomous Vehicles, Public Health, and Social Justice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589976000,"objectID":"92ea5b16d34eb47948c8841e5665d4d9","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/talk/hei/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/hei/","section":"talk","summary":"Conceptual overview of social determinants of health relevant to air pollution.","tags":["air pollution","health inequalities","social determinants"],"title":"Social Determinants of Health--Concepts and Methods Relevant to Air Pollution","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Neal D Goldstein","Ghassan B Hamra","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039256,"objectID":"23c0f7ebe5250bf9a0e693c0213e17d0","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/goldstein-2020-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:36.448771Z","relpermalink":"/publication/goldstein-2020-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Are Descriptions of Methods Alone Sufficient for Study Reproducibility?

The aim was to examine the impact of changes in state-level factors plausibly linked to maternal mortality on overall rates and by race/ethnicity. METHODS: This quasi-experimental, population-based, difference-in-differences study used 2007-2015 National Vital Statistics System microdata mortality files from 38 states and DC. The primary exposures were 5 state-level sexual and reproductive health indicators and 6 health and economic conditions. Maternal mortality rate was defined as number of deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy per 100,000 live births. A difference-in-differences zero-inflated negative binomial regression model was estimated using the race/ethnicity-age-state-year population as the denominator and adjusting for race/ethnicity, age, state, and year. Data were analyzed in 2017-2018. RESULTS: There were 4,767 deaths among women up to age 44 years, resulting in a maternal mortality rate of 17.9. Reducing the proportion of Planned Parenthood clinics by 20% from the state-year mean increased the maternal mortality rate by 8% (incidence rate ratio, 1.08; 95% CI=1.04, 1.12). States that enacted legislation to restrict abortions based on gestational age increased the maternal mortality rate by 38% (incidence rate ratio, 1.38; 95% CI=1.03, 1.84). Planned Parenthood clinic closures negatively impacted all women, increasing mortality by 6%-15% across racial/ethnic groups, whereas gestational limits primarily increased mortality among white women. CONCLUSIONS: Recent fiscal and legislative changes reducing women's access to family planning and reproductive health services have contributed to rising maternal mortality rates.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of State-Level Changes on Maternal Mortality: A Population-Based, Quasi-Experimental Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robin Richardson","Arijit Nandi","Surinder Jaswal","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039254,"objectID":"34d0b8adf48bb474429d66829b01f17f","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/richardson-2020-ab/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:33.956505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/richardson-2020-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: Intimate partner violence (IPV) encompasses physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, as well as controlling behavior. Most research focuses on physical and sexual abuse, and other aspects of IPV are rarely investigated. We estimated the effect of these neglected aspects of IPV on women's mental distress. METHODS: We used data from 3010 women living in rural tribal communities in Rajasthan, India. Women completed baseline interviews and were re-interviewed approximately 1.5 years later. We measured IPV with questions adopted from the Demographic and Health Survey's Domestic Violence Module, which asked seven questions about physical abuse, three questions about psychological abuse, and five questions about partner controlling behavior. Mental distress was measured with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (score range 0-12). We used Poisson regression models to estimate the relation between changes in IPV and mental distress, accounting for time-fixed characteristics of individuals using individual fixed effects. RESULTS: Women reported an average of 2.1 distress symptoms during baseline interviews. In models that controlled for time-varying confounding (e.g., wealth, other types of abuse), experiencing psychological abuse was associated with an increase of 0.65 distress symptoms (95% CI 0.32, 0.98), and experiencing controlling behavior was associated with an increase of 0.31 distress symptoms (95% CI 0.18, 0.44). However, experiencing physical abuse was not associated with an increase in distress symptoms (mean difference = - 0.15, 95% CI - 0.45, 0.15).

We used data on 1,091,424 traffic stops conducted by state troopers in South Carolina in 2005 and 2006 to examine how the change from secondary to primary enforcement of seat belt use in December 2005 affected the number of stops, arrests, and searches to White, Black, and Hispanic drivers using quasi-Poisson and logistic regressions.

The objectives of our study were to (1) examine the gap in life expectancy between white and black persons (hereinafter, racial gap in life expectancy) in 4 states (California, Georgia, Illinois, and New York) and (2) estimate trends in the contribution of major causes of death (CODs) to the racial gap in life expectancy by age group. METHODS: We extracted data on the number of deaths and population sizes for 1969-2013 by state, sex, race, age group, and 6 major CODs. We used a Bayesian time-series model to smooth and impute mortality rates and decomposition methods to estimate trends in sex- and age-specific contributions of CODs to the racial gap in life expectancy. RESULTS: The racial gap in life expectancy at birth decreased in all 4 states, especially among men in New York (from 8.8 to 1.1 years) and women in Georgia (from 8.0 to 1.7 years). Although few deaths occurred among persons aged 1-39, racial differences in mortality at these ages (mostly from injuries and infant mortality) contributed to the racial gap in life expectancy, especially among men in California (1.0 year of the 4.3-year difference in 2013) and Illinois (1.9 years of the 6.7-year difference in 2013). Cardiovascular deaths contributed most to the racial gap in life expectancy for adults aged 40-64, but contributions decreased among women aged 40-64, especially in Georgia (from 2.8 to 0.5 years). The contribution of cancer deaths to inequality increased in California and Illinois, whereas New York had the greatest reductions in inequality attributable to cancer deaths (from 0.6 to 0.2 years among men and from 0.2 to 0 years among women).

STUDY DESIGN: We merged several sources of policy, abortion, and sociodemographic data from 1991-2014. We used a difference-in-differences design to control for time-fixed state-level characteristics and common factors affecting abortion trends across all states, as well as measured time-varying state-level factors that may impact TRAP enforcement and abortion rates. We used generalized linear models with cluster-robust standard errors to obtain our estimates. RESULTS: Enforcement of ambulatory surgical center (ASC) laws reduced the abortion rate by 1.25 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 (95% CI: -3.39, .89), and admitting privilege laws increased the abortion rate by .57 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-44 (95% CI: -.68, 1.83), but neither effect was statistically distinguishable from zero. Our findings were robust to the inclusion of covariates and various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ASC and admitting privilege laws did not, on average, lead to a meaningful change in abortion rates. IMPLICATIONS: US abortion rates are currently at record lows, but our findings suggest that TRAP laws are not a meaningful driver of this trend. However, this does not mean that these laws are without consequence in a particular state (or a given year).

This week I saw an interesting paper published by NBER by D. Mark Anderson, Kyutaro Matsuzawa, and Joseph J. Sabia (an ungated version is posted on Anderson\u0026rsquo;s website) about the impact of marriage equality laws on youth suicide risk.\nObviously, this paper is interesting on it\u0026rsquo;s own: Marriage equality laws may have plausible impacts on mental health, especially among marginalized populations. Anderson et al. also argue that there could be some potential negative consequences for mental health due to political backlash. Thus designing a study to evaluate the impact of legislation on youth suicide piqued my interest.\nAs it turns out, it seems that Anderson et al. also had their interest piqued by a previous paper on this topic, which was published in JAMA Pediatrics. They start by noting:\n A recent article published by Raifman et al. (2017) produces the first empirical evidence on the relationship between SSM legalization and youth mental health. Using data from the State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) for the period 1999-2015, Raifman et al. (2017) find that legalization is associated with a 0.6 percentage-point (7 percent) decline in self-reported suicide attempts among all high school students, and a 4 percentage-point (14 percent) decline in suicide attempts among those who identified as LGBQ relative to suicide attempts among heterosexual-identifying youth.\n Hey\u0026hellip;wait a minute\u0026hellip;something seems familiar here\u0026hellip;Oh yeah! I know that paper! In fact, I reviewed the Raifman (2017) paper for JAMA Pediatrics a couple of years ago:\n   Well. This is indeed interesting. Let\u0026rsquo;s see where it goes\u0026hellip;\n While there is much to admire about the pioneering efforts of Raifman et al. (2017),\n Alright, I\u0026rsquo;m with you\u0026hellip;\n we believe their conclusions deserve closer scrutiny for a number of reasons\u0026hellip;\n Ohhhh, now I think I see what\u0026rsquo;s going on. This feels like replication-town (I\u0026rsquo;ve been there before. It can be nice, but stormy). They make a few arguments regarding limitations of the Raifman paper (which I think can be read for free here), summarized below.\nWhat are their reasons for re-evaluating this question? They give several:\n Access to additional post-treatment data; More flexible difference-in-difference-in-differences (yes, that) specification; Different level of clustering for standard errors; Rescaled survey weights; Composisitional impacts; More outcomes;  I won\u0026rsquo;t discuss all of these, but I certainly encourage you to read the entire paper and judge for yourself. Here is Anderson et al.\u0026rsquo;s bottom line:\n Despite previous research suggesting otherwise, we find little evidence that SSM laws have reduced suicide attempts among teen sexual minorities, nor have they decreased the likelihood of suicide planning, suicide ideation, or depression. Instead, we find some evidence that SSM legalization via judicial mandate is associated with worse mental health for these individuals, consistent with a story of social backlash.\n II. Next, they try and replicate several of the findings of Raifman et al. (2017). I won\u0026rsquo;t digress too much here, except to say that it may come as little surprise to anyone that JAMA Pediatrics does not require (or ask) authors to post either datasets or code that would help to facilitate straightforward computational replication. However, the data are public and the design is relatively straightforward, and Raifman et al. were pretty clear about what they did.\nHere is what Anderson et al. found when they tried to replicate the main findings:\n In column (1) of Table 3, we attempt to replicate the original findings of Raifman et al. (2017). Following Raifman et al. (2017), we estimate equation (1), adjusting standard errors for clustering at the state-by-grade level and weighting regressions using the State YRBS-provided sampling weights. As discussed above, clustering at the state-by-grade level may lead to standard errors that are too small and the State YRBS weights are not designed to be comparable across states or even within states over time. Based on this specification, we find that SSM laws are associated with a 0.66 percentage point decrease in suicide attempts among U.S. high school students. This estimate is statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5 percent level and is nearly identical to the estimate reported in Raifman et al. (2017).\n Nearly identical estimates seems pretty great, and of course this really helps Anderson et al. make their case for how other kinds of choices may have impacted the Raifman et al. results.\nNow here is the part that got me going:\n In column (2), we correct the standard errors by adjusting them for clustering them at the level of policy variation (i.e., the state). This adjustment results in a 56 percent increase in the estimated standard error, rendering the estimate statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional levels.\n So, they find that the standard errors are sensitive to whether they are clustered at the state vs. the state-grade level. In terms of point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, here are those estimates from Anderson et al.:\n   Level of clustering Estimate (percentage points) 95%CI     State, grade -0.66 -1.2, -0.1   State -0.66 -1.5, 0.2    Now, there is, of course, a larger discussion to be had about how we should feel about the difference between those two estimates. Anderson et al. focus on the new results being \u0026ldquo;statistically indistiguishingable\u0026rdquo; from the zero. If one wanted to, one could obtain the analogous p-values for these estimates, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure readers won\u0026rsquo;t be surprised where that would lead. But the larger point is that dealing with clustering for group-level treatments is important and there has been a lot of discussion about it (the title of this post is a riff on a series of blog posts by the economist Chris Blattman and others discussing the issue of clustered standard errors).\nThe other issue I\u0026rsquo;ll discuss is heterogenous effects by sexual minority status. Raifman et al. (2017) reported that the impact of laws in reducing suicide attempts was stronger among sexual minorities (their estimate was -4.0 with a 95%CI of -6.9 to -1.2). However, as Anderson et al. point out, their model only forces all covariates (including state and year fixed effects) to be identical for sexual minorities and heterosexuals. They allow these to differ by using a fully interacted model and compare:\n   Model Estimate 95%CI     Sexual minorities (partially interacted) -4.2 -6.7, -1.6   Sexual minorities (fully interacted) -1.6 -4.9, 1.7    Again, the first estimates are nearly identical to Raifman et al. (2017), but this model choice has serious consequences and reduces the impact among this subpopulation, as Anderson et al. note:\n In panel II of Table 4, we restrict the sample to sexual minorities, allowing the effects of the covariates to differ for this subgroup. In this case, the absolute magnitude of the estimated policy impact falls by 67 percent; we consistently find that SSM laws are associated with a statistically insignificant 1.4 to 1.5 percentage-point reduction in suicide attempts. In panel III, we find no evidence that SSM laws affect suicide attempts among self-identified heterosexuals, and estimates from fully-interacted DDD models (panel IV) are in line with those shown in panel II, suggesting that forcing coefficients on covariates to be equal for sexual minorities and heterosexuals may not be appropriate.\n III. Okay, so why am I going on at such length about these issues? Without trying to sound petulant (and vain), it\u0026rsquo;s because I brought up both of these issues when I first reviewed the paper for JAMA Pediatrics in October of 2016, yet obviously neither the authors nor the editor gave these comments much consideration.\nAt the risk of revealing parts of my review and, in retrospect, things I wish I might have said differently (or not at all), I\u0026rsquo;ll just highlight a couple of points I made in my review. First, on the issue of covariate differences in the \u0026ldquo;partially interacted\u0026rdquo; DD model, I said:\n I think the DDD idea is what the authors are getting at with this: “In the analysis focused on sexual minority youth, we estimated the interaction between state same-sex marriage and sexual minority identity and included binary control indicators for state same-sex marriage and for sexual minority identity.” but this statement is not clear to me. Including the product term between minority status and the treatment variable goes further toward the DDD type estimation, but (as far as I can tell, and since they are not mentioned in Table S2) does not account for state fixed differences in the minority-majority gap in suicide attempts (which could differ by treatment status), or for the fact that there may different secular trends for the minority and majority groups that are common to all states. These can be remedied by including product terms between the state fixed effects and minority status, and the year fixed effects and minority status.   I did not go all the way and ask for separate models, but this is effectively the same issue regarding the DDD specification that Anderson et al. are worried about. Just including a product term in a \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; DD model between the DD coefficient and a group indicator makes strong assumptions about the fixed effects that may not be justified.\nSimilarly, on the issue of clustering:\n More importantly, do the Taylor series standard errors adjust for clustering and potential serial correlation by state? I think they do, but this is an important issue in DD analysis (see the Bertrand paper already cited). I see now in the footnote to Table 2 that SEs were clustered “school and by classroom.” Cameron and Miller (J Hum Res 2015) discuss this situation in particular: “At the minimum, one should cluster at the level of the primary sampling unit though often there is reason to cluster at a broader level, such as clustering on state if regressors and errors are correlated within state.” Because it seems very likely that in the YRBS data for suicide attempts errors are correlated within state and, at a minimum, the authors should also cluster standard errors at the state level in a sensitivity analysis, though my preference would be to do this for the main analysis.   I regret saying \u0026ldquo;I think they do,\u0026rdquo; since I should know better, but also felt like I wanted to be positive and give the authors the benefit of the doubt. Regardless, I thought I made it clear that I did not think the standard errors were clustered at the right level, gave some rationale for why they should be worried about it, and asked that they do this for the main analysis, or at least as a sensitivity analysis. Apparently they did not find this compelling.\nEven more frustrating, when I looked at the email from the editor giving the \u0026ldquo;Revise and Resubmit\u0026rdquo;, I can now see that another reviewer made the same comment(!):\n Clustering. Table 2 refers to clustering by school and classroom. But this is not described in the text. More importantly, I think the authors should show models with clustering at the state level instead of at these other levels. In general standard errors should be clustered at the level at which the treatment varies. Here, that level is state, not classroom or school. This may affect precision; results should be shown with various levels of clustering, similar to the robustness analyses currently shown.   So we have 2 reviewers (the only 2 reviewers, as far as I\u0026rsquo;m aware) both asking (with reasons) for the anlaysis to be done with SE clustered at the state level, yet what we end up with is a paper with SEs clustered at the \u0026ldquo;state and grade level\u0026rdquo;. Is this what we want from peer review? And for all you counterfactualists out there, what do you think would have happened to this paper at JAMA Pediatrics had the authors clustered the standard errors at the state level?\nIV. The purpose of this post isn\u0026rsquo;t to comment specifically about the substantive issues under investigation in these papers (obviously, that is important, too). And it certainly isn\u0026rsquo;t to throw stones at Raifman et al. (disclosure: I know one of the authors personally). I thought the paper had many positive qualities, but needed some additional work and robustness testing. Pretty standard for a lot of DD papers.\nMy concern is about how peer review is handled. We already have a huge problem with research waste in biomedical research, and having smart people like Anderson et al. spend lots of time correcting flaws in a paper that were previously identified during the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; process of peer review seems like a waste of time and resources. Why even bother with peer review at all? Had the first version of this paper been published without any peer review, my guess is that we would see much the same paper by Anderson et al. Yes, on one hand, I can see this as a great example of a well-designed replication paper. Anderson et al. found \u0026ldquo;much to admire\u0026rdquo; in Raifman et al. (2017), but also believed the results deserved to be further interrogated. Plus, they attempt to advance the evidence further by including more post-treatment data, taking advantage of a new potential source of exogenous variation, and looking at other outcomes. All good.\nOn the other hand, however, I\u0026rsquo;m frustrated that the process of peer review in the first go around could have been more transparent. Did the editor communicate to the authors the concerns that both reviewers had about the clustering issue? Perhaps the authors argued against clustering at the state level in their response, but why then did we end up with \u0026ldquo;state-grade\u0026rdquo; clustering? When I spend my time reviewing a paper I generally hope that both the authors and the editor take my comments seriously. But I don\u0026rsquo;t pretend that every comment I make in a review is equally important, or important at all. I can (and do) focus on pendantic, pet issues that bother me, but this is a case where the paper is about a serious policy (and health) issue, the authors are doing some non-standard-practice things and, as we seem to have learned from Anderson et al., these choices actually do make a difference to the results and interpretation.\nPerhaps it is my fault for not following up more closely. In fairness, I may have ticked the box when submitting my review that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to see the paper again, having already invested a lot of time in reviewing it and providing what I thought were helpful comments. In fact, I tried to login to the JAMA Pediatrics site to retrieve my review and see how the paper was handled and perhaps whether I asked not to see it again, and not only is there no record of my review, they don\u0026rsquo;t even have me in the system as a peer reviewer!\n   What the hell kind of clown show is going on here?!\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s also important to say that NBER papers are not peer-reviewed and I\u0026rsquo;m sure Anderson et al.\u0026rsquo;s paper will also benefit from the scrutiny of the peer review process. I just hope that the peer reviewers who use their limited time to provide this crucial activity, free-of-charge, have their reports faithfully considered by editors when making judgements about the paper\u0026rsquo;s merits.\n","date":1571097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571097600,"objectID":"53bf6e0c450d16690ce092ebd7362198","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/post/peer-review/","publishdate":"2019-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/peer-review/","section":"post","summary":"Discussion of a recent paper on same-sex marriage laws.","tags":["replication","reproducible research","peer review","quasi-experiments"],"title":"Clusterjerk: Peer Review Edition!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Nichole Austin","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039254,"objectID":"ab175c68d6eb3ec657b8f6726e3aa909","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/austin-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:34.6063Z","relpermalink":"/publication/austin-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To build a longitudinal state-level database on targeted regulation of abortion providers (TRAP) laws.

RESULTS: The prevalence of tobacco use for men declined from 66% in 2001 to 55% in 2016, and declined from 29% to 8.4% among women. Across both education and wealth quintiles for both men and women, the prevalence of tobacco use generally declines with increasing education or wealth. We found persistently larger absolute inequalities by education than by wealth among men. Among women we also found larger educational than wealth-related gradients, but both declined over time. For men, the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) for education was larger than for wealth (44% vs 26% in 2001) and changed very little over time. For women, the SII for both education and wealth were similar in magnitude to men, but decreased substantially between 2001 and 2016 (from 44% to 16% for education; from 37% to 16% for wealth). Women had a larger relative index of inequality than men for both education (6.5 vs 2.0 in 2001) and wealth (4.8 vs 1.5 in 2001), and relative inequality increased between 2001 and 2016 for women (from 6.5 to 16.0 for education; from 4.8 to 12.0 for wealth).

However, inadequate measurement of agency impedes empirical investigation, and few studies have investigated the relation between agency and health. Using a theory-based measure of women's agency, we investigated the longitudinal association between agency and mental distress among women living in rural Rajasthan, India. Women completed baseline interviews between June and October 2016 and follow-up interviews between June and November 2017 (n = 2859). We measured mental distress with the Hindi version of the 12 item General Health Questionnaire, which asked women 12 questions about symptoms of mental distress (score range: 0-12). We measured agency using a measurement model which was composed of 23 indicators tapping into four domains of agency and validated in a prior research study. We modeled the relation between women's agency and mental distress using Poisson regression and an individual-level fixed effects approach to account for time-fixed characteristics of individuals. In models that controlled for time-varying confounding (e.g., household wealth, number of sons), a one standard deviation increase in agency was associated with a reduction of 0.21 distress symptoms (95% CI: -0.32, -0.09), which corresponds to a 7% reduction (95% CI: 3%, 11%) relative to the mean. We found that specific domains of agency varied in their association with mental distress; namely, an increase in women's agency regarding her attitudes about gender norms corresponded to a reduction in mental distress, whereas an increase in women's agency regarding speaking up in public corresponded to an increase in mental distress. Our research demonstrates that agency may be a determinant of mental health and that comprehensive measurement can reveal nuanced relationships.","tags":["\"agency; empowerment; gender; india; mental distress\""],"title":"The effect of agency on women's mental distress: A prospective cohort study from rural Rajasthan, India","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fadi Hamadani","Tarek Razek","Ezio Massinga","Shailvi Gupta","Monica Muataco","Paloma Muripiha","Catarina Maguni","Vania Muripa","Ivandra Percina","Aassis Costa","Prem Yohannan","David Bracco","Evan Wong","Sam Harper","Dan L Deckelbaum","Otilia Neves"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039253,"objectID":"78956ed32b3eceead0b5867a48ebe77d","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/hamadani-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:33.439614Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hamadani-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Mozambique has had no policy-driven trauma system and no hospital-based trauma registries, and injury was not a public health priority. In other low-income countries, trauma system implementation and trauma registries have helped to reduce mortality from injury by up to 35%. In 2014, we introduced a trauma registry in four hospitals in Maputo serving 18,000 patients yearly. The project has since expanded nationally. This study summarizes the challenges, results, and lessons learned from this large national undertaking. METHODS: Between October 2014-September 2015, we implemented a trauma registry at four hospitals in Maputo. In October 2015, the project began to be expanded nationally. Physicians and allied health professionals at each hospital were trained to implement the registry, and each identified and trained data collectors. We conducted semi-structured interviews with the key stakeholders of this project to identify the challenges, results, and creative solutions implemented for the success of this project. RESULTS: Most participants identified the importance of having a trauma registry and its usefulness in identifying gaps in trauma care. The registry identified that less than 5% of injured patients arrived by ambulance, which served as evidence for the need for a prehospital system, which the Ministry of Health had already begun implementing. Participants also highlighted how the registry has allowed for a structured clinical approach to patients, ensuring that severely injured patients are identified early. Challenges reported included the high rates of missing data, the difficulty in establishing a streamlined flow of trauma patients within each hospital, and the bureaucratic challenges faced when attempting to improve capacity for trauma care at each hospital by introducing a trauma bay and new technologies. Participants identified the need to improve data completeness, to disseminate the results of the project nationally and internationally, to improve inter-divisional cooperation, and to continue educating health providers on the importance of registries. Participants also identified political instabilities in the region as a potential source of challenge in expanding the project nationally; they also identified the lack of uniform resource allocation and low personnel in many areas, especially rural, as a major burden that would need to be overcome. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a trauma registry system in Mozambique is feasible and necessary. Initial findings provide insight into the nature of traumas seen in Maputo hospitals, but also underscore future challenges, especially in minimizing missing data, utilizing data to develop evidence-based trauma prevention policies, and ensuring the sustainability of these efforts by ensuring continued governmental support, education, and resource allocation. Many of these measures are being undertaken.","tags":[],"title":"Trauma Surveillance and Registry Development in Mozambique: Results of a 1-Year Study and the First Phase of National Implementation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039253,"objectID":"c86a252a5d81266490699b190940b833","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2019-ab/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:33.002233Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2019-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"Observational studies are ambiguous, difficult, and necessary for epidemiology.

We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt laws has on fatalities.

For those that don\u0026rsquo;t know, April 20th (or \u0026lsquo;420\u0026rsquo;) is a day of celebration of all things cannabis, with large outdoor gatherings where cannabis consumption is promoted, especially at 4:20pm. The idea behind the paper was that excess consumption of cannabis on April 20th led to more drugged driving, and therefore more fatal accidents.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an interesting and perhaps not implausible idea but, as always, the devil is in the details. The authors, John Staples and Donald Redelmeier used data from the Fatal Accident Accident Reporting System (FARS) and compared drivers involved in fatal accidents on 420 to those involved in accidents one week before and after for the period 1992-2016. This is an interesting design because it inherently compares fatal accidents on the same day of the week, and there is a lot of daily variation in fatal crashes (weekends are particularly deadly).\nThey reported that the number of drivers involved in fatal accidents was 12% higher on 420 compared to control days. This paper made quite a splash in the media, and was the 8th most talked about article for JAMA Internal Medicine in all of 2018:     Of course it also was widely discussed on social media and twitter, for example:\nCelebrating #420day? Maybe also partake an Uber. https://t.co/SCRxSoTAG4 pic.twitter.com/BZsiclK63L\n\u0026mdash; David Juurlink (@DavidJuurlink) April 20, 2018  And the authors also made some pretty strong claims in a press release:\n \u0026ldquo;Assuming fewer than 10 per cent of Americans drive while high on April 20, our results suggest that drug use at 420 celebrations more than doubles the risk of a fatal crash.\u0026rdquo;\n  -Donald Redelmeier, February 12, 2018\n This is a serious claim, though one might argue that the use of the relative term \u0026ldquo;doubling\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t help to quantify how serious the problem might be in the absence of base rates. However, at a time of both liberalization of legislation for recreational marijuana and concern about the impacts of drugged driving, such claims naturally prompted other to look more carefully at the evidence.\nJayson Aydelotte and colleages wrote a letter to the editor at JAMA Internal Medicine specifically interrogating both the validity of considering two days a week before and after as control conditions, and, since 420 has been gaining in popularity, whether any impact might have increased over time.\n Disaggregating the control dates provided additional insights. When comparing the number of crashes for each study date over the study period, in some years the number of crashes on April 20 was quite similar to the number of crashes occurring on at least 1 of the control dates. The April 20 crash rate remained significantly higher than the April 13 crash rate (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.23) but was not significantly different from the April 27 crash rate (IRR, 1.09; 95%CI, 0.99-1.20).\n I\u0026rsquo;ll leave aside the continued focus on arbitrarily dividing the results into \u0026ldquo;significant\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;not significant\u0026rdquo;, which is not helpful, but they argue that April 13 and April 27 do not appear to be \u0026lsquo;equivalent\u0026rsquo; control days (let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, however, that the intervals 1.02-1.23 and 0.99-1.20 are in no way substantively different). They also found weaker effects in more recent years, which is again perhaps at odds with what one would expect if 420 has become more popular.\nUpdate Adam and I also did our own analysis, which has now been published in the journal Injury Prevention, and we were able to replicate the findings of Staples and Redelmeier, but we also ran some additional sensitivity analyses and tried to put the findings in context of what we already know about \u0026ldquo;risky\u0026rdquo; driving days. A few key findings emerged from the paper, and I\u0026rsquo;ll just post a few figures from the paper to try and make the case.\nControl days and uncertainty First, there is a somewhat arcane technical issue related to how to calculate uncertainty around the estimated increase in fatal accidents that happen on 420 relative to \u0026ldquo;control\u0026rdquo; days. Sadly, this is relevant because many prominent journals (including leading medical journals) use filters related to \u0026ldquo;statistical significance\u0026rdquo; as a way to highlight \u0026ldquo;novel\u0026rdquo; findings. In practice, that means it\u0026rsquo;s interesting only if p \u0026lt; 0.05,1 and it is perhaps no surprise that the 420 paper found that, \u0026ldquo;The risk of a fatal crash was significantly higher on April 20 (relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19; P = .001).\u0026rdquo;\nWe investigated this by: a) looking at alternative ways of estimating uncertainty; b) adding control days two weeks before/after the index date of 420 or using all other days as the control period; and c) comparing 420 to July 4th (previously shown to demonstrate excess deaths). Here is a figure showing the comparison between 420 and July 4th (left and right panels, respectively), and for different control periods (upper and lower panels, respectively):\n   The thing to notice here is the greater uncertainty that is evident when one takes a more robust approach to estimating the variance, which may have tipped the paper into the p \u0026gt;0.05 of what Edward Tufte used to call the \u0026ldquo;zone of boredom, ambiguity, and unpublishability\u0026rdquo;. But you can also see that expanding the control period to 2 weeks (or the rest of the year) diminshes any impact of 420, but not July 4th, which appears very reliably associated with excess deaths.\nCompared to what? Second, we also tried to look at how the \u0026ldquo;excess risk\u0026rdquo; on 420 compares with similar risks on all other days of the year. We basically just ran the same simple negative binomial regression for each day using 2 control days a week apart for each day of the year. The graph below shows the results on the (log) rate ratio scale:\n   You can see from the figure above that the excess risk on 420 does not seem readily distinguishable from daily variations across the entire year. Some clear risky days stand out (July 4th, for example), but if one applies the same filter as the 420 paper and just looks for days when there are \u0026ldquo;significant\u0026rdquo; relative excesses (or deficits) of fatal crashes,2 there are actually a lot of days that need explaining:\n   I wonder if one just picked random years whether any of these days would be reliably associated with excess deaths? I would gather July 4th but, as it stands, it is hard to find plausible explanations for why some of these days stand out.\nTransient or persistent? Finally, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model and partial pooling across years to evaluate whether any impact of 420 changed over time (this was also partially addressed by the letter from Aydelotte et al.). The plots below show results from models where we allowed the impact of certain \u0026ldquo;key\u0026rdquo; dates well-known to be associated with excess fatal crashes (July 4th, Labor Day weekend) to vary over time. Since 420 is a recent phenomenon we wondered whether we could see changes over time (increases?) in excess deaths. What does seem clear is that there is no reliable excess of drivers involved in fatal crashes on 420, but very clear excesses (and deficits) on other days. This speaks to whether one might just argue that the data are too noisy to detect any reliable signal.\n   A couple of final points. As we mentioned in the other post, there are also important questions about whether, practically speaking, it is plausible that drugged driving on 420 would be serious enough to raise the population-wide rate of fatal accidents by something like 12%. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe, and our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that around 15% of the population would need to be driving while high on 420 from 4:20pm to midnight to generate the kinds of excess rates seen in the Staples/Redelmeier paper.\nAnd I should also say that this paper was not an attack on the original work by Staples and Redelmeier. I will cop to seeing the paper and being skeptical about the results, but through the process of trying to reproduce their results, we started to think about new questions that could be asked of the data, what kinds of methods might be necessary to answer a question like this, and in general I think this ended up being a really interesting process of discovery. I should also say that because we decided to make all of the data and code available when we submitted the paper (which was first rejected by the Canadian Medical Association Journal), the review process at Injury Prevention was really productive:\n1/7: Thread related to a recent experience with #reproducible #research and #peer #review #epitwitter #openscience\nI have recently begun uploading data (where feasible) and code to an accessible public repository (@OSFramework) to reproduce results at the time of submission.\n\u0026mdash; Sam Harper (@sbh4th) December 6, 2018  Paper + Data + Code If anyone is interested in the paper the gated version is now posted on Injury Prevention\u0026rsquo;s website, but we have posted a preprint on my Open Science Foundation page, and we have made all of the raw data and code available to reproduce our results publicly available as well.

The Health Disparity Calculator software (HD*Calc, v1.2.4) offers Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based confidence interval (CI) estimation of eleven disparity measures. The MCS approach provides accurate CI estimation, except when data are scarce (e.g., rare cancers). To address sparse data challenges to CI estimation, we propose two solutions: 1) employing the gamma distribution in the MCS and 2) utilizing a zero-inflated Poisson estimate for Poisson sampling in simulation experiments. We evaluate each solution through simulation studies using female breast, female brain, lung, and cervical cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.

Yet it remains controversial whether the link between short interpregnancy interval and adverse outcomes is causal or is confounded by factors such as low socioeconomic position, inadequate access to health care, and unintended pregnancy. Sibling comparison studies, which use a woman as her own control by comparing exposure and outcome status of her different pregnancies (i.e., comparing sibling offspring), have gained popularity as a strategy to reduce confounding by these difficult-to-measure factors that are nevertheless relatively stable within women. A variant of this approach, used by Regan et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2019;188(1):9-16) and reported in this issue of the Journal, is a maternally matched design based on a single interpregnancy interval per woman. Using real and simulated data, we highlight underappreciated shortcomings of these designs that could limit the validity of study findings. In particular, we illustrate how the single-interval variant appears to derive estimates from comparisons between different mothers, not within mothers. Future studies of optimal birth spacing using sibling comparison designs should examine in detail the potential consequences of these methodological limitations.","tags":[],"title":"Invited Commentary: Promise and Pitfalls of the Sibling Comparison Design in Studies of Optimal Birth Spacing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katherine A Ahrens","Jennifer A Hutcheon","Cande V Ananth","Olga Basso","Peter A Briss","Cynthia D Ferré","Brittni N Frederiksen","Sam Harper","Sonia Hernández-Dı́az","Ashley H Hirai","Russell S Kirby","Mark A Klebanoff","Laura Lindberg","Sunni L Mumford","Heidi D Nelson","Robert W Platt","Lauren M Rossen","Alison M Stuebe","Marie E Thoma","Catherine J Vladutiu","Susan Moskosky"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039251,"objectID":"d7d761e900d0be06b263a3dd6702d636","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/ahrens-2019-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:31.619287Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ahrens-2019-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that women wait at least 24 months after a livebirth before attempting a subsequent pregnancy to reduce the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal, and infant health outcomes.

Broadly defined, health disparities refer to preventable inequalities in health status, such as cancer to ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, education, environment, and geographic locations. To make informed health policy decisions, it is essential to precisely measure the magnitude of disparities and assess trends over time. The Health Disparities Calculator (HD*Calc) is free statistical software that calculates 11 commonly used measures of health disparities and provides corresponding 95% CIs for the 11 measures using either an analytic method or a Monte Carlo simulation-based method; however, the derivation of SEs and coverage properties of the CIs have not been formally evaluated. We used simulation studies to assess the coverage properties of these CIs. We have also conducted bias analyses for measures implemented in HD*Calc using age-adjusted cancer incidence rates from national, state, and county level SEER data. The results of these analyses indicate that HD*Calc should be used with caution to construct CIs for some health disparity measures when the proportion of zero event counts is greater than 25%.","tags":[],"title":"Variance Estimation and Confidence Intervals for 11 Commonly Used Health Disparity Measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robin A Richardson","Sam Harper","Norbert Schmitz","Arijit Nandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039251,"objectID":"ff434ab8364580234b47a1d46efe4f12","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/richardson-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:31.384023Z","relpermalink":"/publication/richardson-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Access to affordable daycare might improve population mental health. However, evidence is sparse and restricted to middle- and high-income country settings. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in one low-income setting, rural Rajasthan, India.

Women eligible for the daycare program living in these communities completed structured interviews before the intervention (participation rate = 89%) and approximately one year after rollout of the intervention (participation rate = 96%), resulting in a final analytic sample of 3041. Mental distress was measured with the Hindi version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (score range: 0-12). We modeled the relation between access to daycare and number of mental distress symptoms (GHQ-12 score) with negative binomial regression using an intention-to-treat approach, which groups women according to if they lived in communities randomized to affordable daycare. We also evaluated the effect of access to daycare on secondary outcomes that may be related to mental distress, including women's work burden, agency, and intimate partner violence (IPV). We found that access to daycare resulted in modest reductions in symptoms of mental distress (mean difference = 0.21, 95% CI: -0.43, 0.02). We found some evidence that daycare reduced IPV, but virtually no change in women's work burden or agency.

IDU (in the past six months) and IDU frequency (non-weekly/weekly in the past month) were self-reported.

METHODS: Nationally-representative survey examination data were used to calculate adjusted absolute differences (AD) in prevalence of untreated decay and fair/poor self-rated oral health (SROH) in income and education. We pooled age- and gender-adjusted inequality estimates using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: New Zealand demonstrated the highest adjusted estimate for untreated decay; the US showed the highest adjusted prevalence of fair/poor SROH. The meta-analysis showed little heterogeneity across countries for the prevalence of decayed teeth; the pooled ADs were 19.7 (95% CI = 16.7-22.7) and 12.0 (95% CI = 8.4-15.7) between highest and lowest education and income groups, respectively.

By targeting the period around childbirth, access to paid parental leave also appears to reduce rates of infant mortality, with breastfeeding representing one potential mechanism. The provision of more generous paid leave entitlements in countries that offer unpaid or short durations of paid leave could help families strike a balance between the competing demands of earning income and attending to personal and family well-being. CONTEXT: Policies legislating paid leave from work for new parents, and to attend to individual and family illness, are common across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. However, there exists no comprehensive review of their potential impacts on economic, social, and health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on paid leave and socioeconomic and health outcomes. We reviewed 5,538 abstracts and selected 85 published papers on the impact of parental leave policies, 22 papers on the impact of medical leave policies, and 2 papers that evaluated both types of policies. We synthesized the main findings through a narrative description; a meta-analysis was precluded by heterogeneity in policy attributes, policy changes, outcomes, and study designs. FINDINGS: We were able to draw several conclusions about the impact of parental leave policies. First, extensions in the duration of paid parental leave to between 6 and 12 months were accompanied by attendant increases in leave-taking and longer durations of leave. Second, there was little evidence that extending the duration of paid leave had negative employment or economic consequences. Third, unpaid leave does not appear to confer the same benefits as paid leave. Fourth, from a population health perspective, increases in paid parental leave were consistently associated with better infant and child health, particularly in terms of lower mortality rates. Fifth, paid paternal leave policies of adequate length and generosity have induced fathers to take additional time off from work following the birth of a child. How medical leave policies for personal or family illness influence health has not been widely studied. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial quasi-experimental evidence to support expansions in the duration of job-protected paid parental leave as an instrument for supporting women's labor force participation, safeguarding women's incomes and earnings, and improving child survival. This has implications, in particular, for countries that offer shorter durations of job-protected paid leave or lack a national paid leave entitlement altogether.","tags":["\"oecd; child health; employment; parental leave; policy analysis; population health; sick leave; socioeconomic factors\""],"title":"The Impact of Parental and Medical Leave Policies on Socioeconomic and Health Outcomes in OECD Countries: A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"(with Jill Baumgartner)\nAir pollution is a leading public health problem.

This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the day-care system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.\nThe video below provides some additional details about the project and some essential context for where this work is being done.\n ","date":1535569974,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535569974,"objectID":"32bd7619c14ced33d0552b128bf1e1d8","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/project/u2/","publishdate":"2018-08-29T15:12:54-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/u2/","section":"project","summary":"Evaluating the impact of daycare on women and children","tags":["evaluation","randomized","women's empowerment","Past"],"title":"Affordable Daycare To Empower Indian Women","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sarah Meghan Mah","Claudia Sanmartin","Sam Harper","Nancy A Ross"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039250,"objectID":"31346765e36cbba6f91faece4423b27e","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/mah-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:29.815612Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mah-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Hospital utilization varies across socioeconomic and demographic strata in Canada, a country with a universal health care system. Rates of adverse birth outcomes are known to differ among women of high and low socioeconomic status (SES), but less is known of the excess hospital burden related to SES over the course of childbirth across Canadian provinces. Objective: To examine length of stay and risk of hospitalization surrounding delivery, relative to women's socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: A population-based record linkage between the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) years 2005-2011 and the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) allowed the tracking of hospital utilization for linked survey respondents between 2005 and 2011. Hourly length of stay for delivery, risk of readmission, and risk of admission prior to delivery was modeled by socio-demographic factors, controlling for other clinical and individual-level characteristics. Results: There were 21,914 complete delivery records from 15,458 female CCHS respondents who agreed to link and share their information. Average length of stay (for both vaginal and Caesarian deliveries) dropped over the study period from 67.86 hours in 2005 to 59.37 hours in 2011. In multivariate analyses, women with the lowest income had on average, two-hour longer stays for vaginal delivery as compared to high-income women (IRR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.08) and higher risk of admission prior to delivery (OR 1.43, CI 1.13-1.81). Low-income women, Aboriginal women and women living in rural areas were also at elevated risk for longer hospital stays and for hospital admission prior to delivery. There was no consistent socioeconomic patterning of hospital burden for Caesarian deliveries. Conclusion: The length of hospital stays for childbirth has declined in Canada. Length of stay remains modestly longer, and risk of hospitalization in the perinatal period higher, for low income women, Aboriginal women and rural women. The absence of egregious income-related differences in hospital burden related to childbirth is reassuring for the equity goals of the Canadian health care system. The persistence of marginally longer, and in turn, costlier visits for low-income and Aboriginal women before and during delivery is, however, suggestive that resources targeted to the prenatal period might be highly cost-effective if they achieve population-wide reductions in length of stay and hospitalization in the perinatal period.","tags":[],"title":"Childbirth-Related Hospital Burden by Socioeconomic Status in a Universal Health Care Setting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Corinne A Riddell","Kathryn T Morrison","Jay S Kaufman","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039249,"objectID":"3faf39eea7ffedacfedd563b00b993a1","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/riddell-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:29.165238Z","relpermalink":"/publication/riddell-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Life expectancy has increased in the United States over many decades.

Inverse probability of censoring weights are a method to account for this source of bias. The objective of this article is to examine and correct for the influence of selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality on the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and all-cause mortality after an acute cardiac event. METHODS: The relationship between the number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (0-5; smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity) and all-cause mortality was examined using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. To illustrate the magnitude of selection bias, estimates from an unweighted generalized linear model with a log link and binomial distribution were compared with estimates from an inverse probability of censoring weighted model. RESULTS: In unweighted multivariable analyses the estimated risk ratio for mortality ranged from 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.21) for 1 CVD risk factor to 1.95 (95% CI, 1.41-2.68) for 5 CVD risk factors. In the inverse probability of censoring weights weighted analyses, the risk ratios ranged from 1.14 (95% CI, 0.94-1.39) to 4.23 (95% CI, 2.69-6.66). CONCLUSION: Estimates from the inverse probability of censoring weighted model were substantially greater than unweighted, adjusted estimates across all risk factor categories. This shows the magnitude of selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality and effect on estimates of the effect of CVD risk factors on mortality. Moreover, the results highlight the utility of using this method to address a common form of bias in cardiovascular research.","tags":[],"title":"Accounting for Selection Bias in Studies of Acute Cardiac Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Corinne A Riddell","Sam Harper","Magdalena Cerdá","Jay S Kaufman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039248,"objectID":"540583a205938a49c1fcd5cab9b5665e","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/riddell-2018-ab/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:28.3947Z","relpermalink":"/publication/riddell-2018-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: The extent to which differences in homicide and suicide rates in black versus white men vary by U.S. state is unknown. Objective: To compare the rates of firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white non-Hispanic men by U.S. state and to examine whether these deaths are associated with state prevalence of gun ownership. Design: Surveillance study. Setting: 50 states and the District of Columbia, 2008 to 2016. Cause-of-death data were abstracted by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. Participants: Non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white males, all ages. Measurements: Absolute rates of and rate differences in firearm and nonfirearm homicide and suicide in black and white men. Results: During the 9-year study period, 84 113 homicides and 251 772 suicides occurred. Black-white differences in rates of firearm homicide and suicide varied widely across states. Relative to white men, black men had between 9 and 57 additional firearm homicides per 100 000 per year, with black men in Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Pennsylvania having more than 40 additional firearm homicides per 100 000 per year. White men had between 2 fewer and 16 more firearm suicides per 100 000 per year, with the largest inequalities observed in southern and western states and the smallest in the District of Columbia and densely populated northeastern states. Limitations: Some homicides and suicides may have been misclassified as deaths due to unintentional injury. Survey data on state household gun ownership were collected in 2004 and may have shifted during the past decade. Conclusion: The large state-to-state variation in firearm homicide and suicide rates, as well as the racial inequalities in these numbers, highlights states where policies may be most beneficial in reducing homicide and suicide deaths and the racial disparities in their rates.

Understanding the impact of these laws is important given their prevalence in the USA, but no review to date has summarised the available evidence. We conducted a systematic review of literature on TRAP laws and their impact on abortion trends and women's health. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed and EconLit for original, quantitative studies where the exposure was at least one TRAP policy and the outcome was abortion and/or any women's physical or mental health outcome. RESULTS: Six articles met our inclusion criteria. The most common outcome was population-level abortion trends; studies also assessed the effect of TRAP laws on gestational age at presentation and measures of self-perceived burden. While certain TRAP laws (eg, admitting privilege requirements) appeared to have an effect on abortion outcomes, the impact of other laws - or combinations of laws - was unclear, due in part to heterogeneity between studies with respect to study design, geography, and exposure definition. CONCLUSIONS: TRAP laws may have an impact on the experience of obtaining an abortion in the USA. However, our review revealed a paucity of empirical research on their population and individual-level impact, as well as some disagreement about the effect of different TRAP laws on subsequent abortion outcomes. Future research should prioritise the specific TRAP laws that may have a uniquely strong effect on state-level abortion rates and other outcomes.","tags":["trap laws","abortion policy","women's health"],"title":"Assessing the impact of TRAP laws on abortion and women's health in the USA: a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Taylor McLinden","Erica E M Moodie","Anne-Marie Hamelin","Sam Harper","Carmine Rossi","Sharon L Walmsley","Sean B Rourke","Curtis Cooper","Marina B Klein","Joseph Cox"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039247,"objectID":"1e5162b89e036546a794ba3a6f034f86","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/mc-linden-2018-ab/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:27.678078Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mc-linden-2018-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Severe food insecurity (FI) is common among individuals living with HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection. We hypothesize that the injection of opioids is partly responsible for the association between injection drug use and severe FI. Therefore, this analysis examines whether methadone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence is associated with a lower risk of severe FI. METHODS: We used biannual data from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (N = 608, 2012-2015). Methadone treatment (exposure) was self-reported and severe FI (outcome) was measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module. To quantify the association between methadone treatment and severe FI, we estimated an average treatment effect on the treated (marginal risk difference [RD]) using propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among participants, 25% experienced severe FI in the six months preceding the first time-point in the analytical sample and 5% concurrently reported receiving methadone treatment. Injection of opioids in the six months preceding the treatment and outcome measurements was much higher among those who received methadone treatment (39% vs. 12%). Among the treated participants, 97% had injected opioids in their lifetimes. After propensity score matching, the average risk of experiencing severe FI is 12.3 percentage-points lower among those receiving methadone treatment, compared to those who are not receiving treatment (marginal RD = -0.123, 95% CI = -0.230, -0.015). CONCLUSIONS: After adjustment for socioeconomic, sociodemographic, behavioural, and clinical confounders, methadone treatment is associated with a lower risk of severe FI.

Yet, use of this proven treatment remains sub-optimal in Canadian clinical practice, with as many as 40% of eligible preterm births at 24-33 weeks’ gestation not receiving antenatal corticosteroids as recommended in Canadian and international practice guidelines.\nOne important factor contributing to low antenatal corticosteroids use is the lack of rigorous data on their longer-term safety for child health. There is no clear evidence of adverse effects, but signals of harm from selected animal and human studies have created concerns that antenatal corticosteroids may impair child neurodevelopment. However, all of these studies are low quality. Follow-up studies of randomized trials were hampered by low follow-up rates and small sample sizes, and observational studies were highly susceptible to confounding. High-quality evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal corticosteroids for child neurodevelopment is critical for optimizing use of this medication.\nWhen randomization is infeasible, regression discontinuity studies can provide evidence on the causal effects of a drug or exposure. The design exploits differences in clinical care among individuals immediately on either side of a clinical or policy cut-point as a pseudo-randomization tool. With antenatal corticosteroids, clinical practice guidelines recommend administration up to 33+6 weeks’ gestation (33 weeks, 6 days) – but not one day later, at 34+0 weeks. This (somewhat) arbitrary cut-off means that infants born as little as hours apart have substantially different chances of receiving this effective treatment. Using preliminary data from over 8500 preterm births in British Columbia, we have shown that regression discontinuity analysis can replicate the clinical trial findings on short-term neonatal respiratory morbidity. We propose to now link our cohort with child development outcomes, and use this novel design to generate rigorous evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal steroids.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if antenatal corticosteroid administration decreases kindergarten child development scores (primary outcome) or increases risks of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such cerebral palsy or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAPPROACH: We will use a population-based cohort of 12,653 preterm births from British Columbia, Canada, 2000-2013. Obstetrical and neonatal medical records contained in the BC Perinatal Data Registry will be linked with provincial school child development assessments, hospitalization, prescription, and physician visit data. Our primary outcome will be child development scores based on the Early Development Instrument, a validated tool routinely administered by kindergarten teachers across Canada and internationally. International classification of diseases codes and prescriptions will be used to identify our secondary outcomes of cerebral palsy and ADHD. We will use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of antenatal corticosteroids on outcomes among infants born on either side of the 34+0 weeks’ cut-point within a narrow gestational age window.\nPUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is the single most important cause of neonatal mortality and severe morbidity in Canada, and costs the Canadian health care system over $8 billion per year. Antenatal corticosteroids can reduce this burden of disease by 30% for as low as $1 per dose, but the unknown potential for longer-term harm hinders their use in clinical practice. Our findings will inform evidence-based Canadian clinical practice guidelines that address the potential longer-term harms associated with antenatal corticosteroids. This will enable physicians to optimize use of this treatment with proven neonatal benefits that may currently be being avoided unnecessarily.\nFunding: Canadian Institutes for Health Research\n","date":1516579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516579200,"objectID":"b63e9bdc9c5e7d7f7268feadc72905a0","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/project/steroids/","publishdate":"2018-01-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/steroids/","section":"project","summary":"Assessing the consequences of antenatal corticosteroid administration on child neurodevelopment","tags":["evaluation","pregnancy","quasi-experimental","Current"],"title":"Antenatal Steroids and Child Health","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chandrashekhar T Sreeramareddy","Sam Harper","Linda Ernstsen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039243,"objectID":"739316c05f49fbb28450725dc749c22b","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/sreeramareddy-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:23.67599Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sreeramareddy-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic differentials of tobacco smoking in high-income countries are well described. However, studies to support health policies and place monitoring systems to tackle socioeconomic inequalities in smoking and smokeless tobacco use common in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) are seldom reported. We aimed to describe, sex-wise, educational and wealth-related inequalities in tobacco use in LMICs. METHODS: We analysed Demographic and Health Survey data on tobacco use collected from large nationally representative samples of men and women in 54 LMICs. We estimated the weighted prevalence of any current tobacco use (including smokeless tobacco) in each country for 4 educational groups and 4 wealth groups. We calculated absolute and relative measures of inequality, that is, the slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII), which take into account the distribution of prevalence across all education and wealth groups and account for population size. We also calculated the aggregate SII and RII for low-income (LIC), lower-middle-income (lMIC) and upper-middle-income (uMIC) countries as per World Bank classification. FINDINGS: Male tobacco use was highest in Bangladesh (70.3%) and lowest in Sao Tome (7.4%), whereas female tobacco use was highest in Madagascar (21%) and lowest in Tajikistan (0.22%). Among men, educational inequalities varied widely between countries, but aggregate RII and SII showed an inverse trend by country wealth groups. RII was 3.61 (95% CI 2.83 to 4.61) in LICs, 1.99 (95% CI 1.66 to 2.38) in lMIC and 1.82 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.67) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among men varied less between countries, but RII and SII showed an inverse pattern where RII was 2.43 (95% CI 2.05 to 2.88) in LICs, 1.84 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.21) in lMICs and 1.67 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.42) in uMICs. For educational inequalities among women, the RII varied much more than SII varied between the countries, and the aggregate RII was 14.49 (95% CI 8.87 to 23.68) in LICs, 3.05 (95% CI 1.44 to 6.47) in lMIC and 1.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 7.56) in uMIC. Wealth inequalities among women showed a pattern similar to that of men: the RII was 5.88 (95% CI 3.91 to 8.85) in LICs, 1.76 (95% CI 0.80 to 3.85) in lMIC and 0.39 (95% CI 0.09 to 1.64) in uMIC. In contrast to men, among women, the SII was pro-rich (higher smoking among the more advantaged) in 13 of the 52 countries (7 of 23 lMIC and 5 of 7 uMIC). INTERPRETATION: Our results confirm that socioeconomic inequalities tobacco use exist in LMIC, varied widely between the countries and were much wider in the lowest income countries. These findings are important for better understanding and tackling of socioeconomic inequalities in health in LMIC.","tags":["\"disparities; global health; low/middle income country; smoking caused disease; socioeconomic status\""],"title":"Educational and wealth inequalities in tobacco use among men and women in 54 low-income and middle-income countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas B King","Sam Harper","Meredith Young","Sarah C Berry","Kristin Voigt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039248,"objectID":"88875833a34971de8b9f277f701535c9","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/king-2018-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:27.99927Z","relpermalink":"/publication/king-2018-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project systematically assesses mortality, healthy life expectancy, and disability across 195 countries and territories, using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY). Disability weights in the DALY are based upon surveys that ask users to rate health states based on lay descriptions. We conducted an experimental study to examine whether the inclusion or removal of psychological, social, or familial implications from a health state description might affect individual judgments about disease severity, and thus relative disability weights. METHODS: We designed a survey consisting of 36 paired descriptions in which information about plausible psychological, social, or familial implications of a health condition was either present or absent. Using a Web-based platform, we recruited 1,592 participants, who were assigned to one of two experimental groups, each of which were asked to assign a value to the health state description from 0 to 100 using a slider, with 0 as the \\\"worst possible health\\\" and 100 as the \\\"best possible health.\\\" We tested five hypotheses: (1) the inclusion of psychological, social, or familial consequences in health state descriptions will reduce the average rating of a health state; (2) the effect will be stronger for diseases with lower disability weights (i.e., less severe diseases); (3) the effect will vary across the type of additional information added to the health state description; (4) the impact of adding information on familial consequences will be stronger for female than male; (5) the effect of additional consequences on ratings of health state descriptions will not differ by levels of completed education and age. RESULTS: On average, adding social, psychological, or familial consequences to the health state description lowered individual ratings of that description by 0.78 points. The impact of adding information had a stronger impact on ratings of the least severe conditions, reducing average ratings in this category by 1.67 points. Addition of information about child-rearing had the strongest impact, reducing average ratings by 2.09 points. We found little evidence that the effect of adding information on ratings of health descriptions varied by gender, education, or age. CONCLUSIONS: Including information about health states not directly related to major functional consequences or symptoms, particularly with respect to child-rearing and specifically for descriptions of less severe conditions, can lead to lower ratings of health. However, this impact was not consistent across all conditions or types of information, and was most pronounced for inclusion of information about child-rearing, and among the least severe conditions.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of social and psychological consequences of disease on judgments of disease severity: An experimental study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robin A Richardson","Arijit Nandi","Surinder Jaswal","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039247,"objectID":"b0d8880f103eca49cfaeb36e359854e1","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/richardson-2017-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:27.497343Z","relpermalink":"/publication/richardson-2017-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: High work demands might be a determinant of poor mental health among women in low- and middle-income countries, especially in rural settings where women experience greater amounts of labor-intensive unpaid work.

A structured questionnaire captured the number of minutes women spent on various activities in the last 24 h, and we used this information to measure women's work demands, including the total work amount, nature of work (e.g., housework), and type of work (e.g., cooking). Mental distress was measured with the Hindi version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. We used negative binomial regression models to estimate the association between work demands (amount, nature, and type) and mental distress. RESULTS: On average, women spent more than 9.5 h a day on work activities. The most time, intensive work activity was caring for children, the elderly, or disabled (149 min). In adjusted models, we found a U-shaped association between work amount and mental distress. High amounts of housework were associated with higher distress, whereas paid work and farmwork amount were not. Certain types of housework, including collecting water and cleaning, were associated with increased distress scores.

Given the importance of unemployment as a proximal risk factor for FI, this mediation analysis examines a potential mechanism through which injection drug use (IDU) is associated with severe FI. We used biannual data from the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (N = 429 with 3 study visits, 2012-2015). IDU in the past 6 months (exposure) and current unemployment (mediator) were self-reported. Severe FI in the following 6 months (outcome) was measured using the Household Food Security Survey Module. An overall association and a controlled direct effect were estimated using marginal structural models. Among participants, 32% engaged in IDU, 78% were unemployed, and 29% experienced severe FI. After adjustment for confounding and addressing censoring through weighting, the overall association (through all potential pathways) between IDU and severe FI was: risk ratio (RR) = 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15-2.48). The controlled direct effect (the association through all potential pathways except that of unemployment) was: RR = 1.65 (95% CI = 1.08-2.53). We found evidence of an overall association between IDU and severe FI and estimated a controlled direct effect that is suggestive of pathways from IDU to severe FI that are not mediated by unemployment. Specifically, an overall association and a controlled direct effect that are similar in magnitude suggests that the potential impact of IDU on unemployment is not the primary mechanism through which IDU is associated with severe FI. Therefore, while further research is required to understand the mechanisms linking IDU and severe FI, the strong overall association suggests that reductions in IDU may mitigate severe FI in this vulnerable subset of the HIV-positive population.","tags":["\"hiv; hepatitis c virus; injection drug use; severe food insecurity; unemployment\""],"title":"Injection Drug Use, Unemployment, and Severe Food Insecurity Among HIV-HCV Co-Infected Individuals: A Mediation Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper","Jay S Kaufman","Richard S Cooper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039246,"objectID":"022a5b998f53f90f1460be8aaa7d806f","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2017-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:26.393759Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2017-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Declining US Life Expectancy: A First Look","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erin C Strumpf","Thomas J Charters","Sam Harper","Arijit Nandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039247,"objectID":"031d49a505f40e4af64852ff6d48e5dd","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/strumpf-2017-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:27.310605Z","relpermalink":"/publication/strumpf-2017-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: Mortality rates generally decline during economic recessions in high-income countries, however gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study estimates the impacts of increases in unemployment rates on both all-cause and cause-specific mortality across U.S. metropolitan regions during the Great Recession. METHODS: We estimate the effects of economic conditions during the recent and severe recessionary period on mortality, including differences by age and gender subgroups, using fixed effects regression models. We identify a plausibly causal effect by isolating the impacts of within-metropolitan area changes in unemployment rates and controlling for common temporal trends. We aggregated vital statistics, population, and unemployment data at the area-month-year-age-gender-race level, yielding 527,040 observations across 366 metropolitan areas, 2005-2010. RESULTS: We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the metropolitan area unemployment rate was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality of 3.95 deaths per 100,000 person years (95%CI -6.80 to -1.10), or 0.5%. Estimated reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed 60% of the overall effect and were more pronounced among women. Motor vehicle accident mortality declined with unemployment increases, especially for men and those under age 65, as did legal intervention and homicide mortality, particularly for men and adults ages 25-64. We find suggestive evidence that increases in metropolitan area unemployment increased accidental drug poisoning deaths for both men and women ages 25-64. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that all-cause mortality decreased during the Great Recession is consistent with previous studies. Some categories of cause-specific mortality, notably cardiovascular disease, also follow this pattern, and are more pronounced for certain gender and age groups. Our study also suggests that the recent recession contributed to the growth in deaths from overdoses of prescription drugs in working-age adults in metropolitan areas. Additional research investigating the mechanisms underlying the health consequences of macroeconomic conditions is warranted.","tags":["age-specific mortality","cause of death","economic recession","gender-specific mortality","great recession","metropolitan area","mortality","united states"],"title":"Did the Great Recession affect mortality rates in the metropolitan United States?

The purpose of this study was to test whether recent upgrades to primary enforcement still reduce motor vehicle crash deaths. METHODS: In 2016, researchers used motor vehicle crash death data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System for 2000-2014 and calculated rates using both person- and exposure-based denominators. Researchers used a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of primary enforcement on death rates, and estimated negative binomial regression models, controlling for age, substance use involvement, fixed state characteristics, secular trends, state median household income, and other state-level traffic safety policies. RESULTS: Models adjusted only for crash characteristics and state-level covariates models showed a protective effect of primary enforcement (rate ratio, 0.88, 95% CI=0.77, 0.98; rate difference, -1.47 deaths per 100,000 population, 95% CI= -2.75, -0.19). After adjustment for fixed state characteristics and secular trends, there was no evidence of an effect of upgrading from secondary to primary enforcement in the whole population (rate ratio, 0.98, 95% CI=0.92, 1.04; rate difference, -0.22, 95% CI= -0.90, 0.46) or for any age group.

We used regression models with province and year fixed effects, and individual-level and provincial-level covariates on 2002-2012 data from the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey. RESULTS: Tax increases generally did not affect smoking outcomes. Each increase of CAD $1.00 (adjusted to year 2000 dollars) in excise cigarette taxes per package of 20 was associated with a 0.2 percentage point (95% CI: -1.8; 2.2) change in smoking prevalence, and a change of 0.3 in mean cigarettes smoked in the past week (95% CI: -1.2; 1.8). CONCLUSION: From 2002 to 2012, smoking prevalence and mean smoking frequency were in steady decline among youths in Canada. This decline, however, was evident even among provinces with stable or decreasing cigarette tax levels. Tobacco taxes have mostly increased since the 1980s, and so, tax levels were already quite high by the launch of the FTCS. Province fixed effects and common temporal changes accounted for 83.7% of the variation in smoking prevalence. We derived similar results for smoking frequency. The cumulative tax increase during our study period was at least $1.00 for only three provinces. Thus, our findings suggest that factors driving down tobacco use among youths in all provinces appear to outweigh any impact of small tax increases at already high tax levels.","tags":[],"title":"The contribution of excise cigarette taxes on the decline in youth smoking in Canada during the time of the Federal Tobacco Control Strategy (2002-2012)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Catherine Arsenault","Mira Johri","Arijit Nandi","José M Mendoza Rodrı́guez","Peter M Hansen","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039246,"objectID":"83f2344a542e4ef825df23f1907c5c71","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/arsenault-2017-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:25.958233Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arsenault-2017-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Important inequalities in childhood vaccination coverage persist between countries and population groups. Understanding why some countries achieve higher and more equitable levels of coverage is crucial to redress these inequalities. In this study, we explored the country-level determinants of (1) coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis- (DTP3) containing vaccine and (2) within-country inequalities in DTP3 coverage in 45 countries supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. METHODS: We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 2005 and 2014. We measured national DTP3 coverage and the slope index of inequality in DTP3 coverage with respect to household wealth, maternal education, and multidimensional poverty. We collated data on country health systems, health financing, governance and geographic and sociocultural contexts from published sources. We used meta-regressions to assess the relationship between these country-level factors and variations in DTP3 coverage and inequalities. To validate our findings, we repeated these analyses for coverage with measles-containing vaccine (MCV). RESULTS: We found considerable heterogeneity in DTP3 coverage and in the magnitude of inequalities across countries. Results for MCV were consistent with those from DTP3. Political stability, gender equality and smaller land surface were important predictors of higher and more equitable levels of DTP3 coverage. Inequalities in DTP3 coverage were also lower in countries receiving more external resources for health, with lower rates of out-of-pocket spending and with higher national coverage. Greater government spending on heath and lower linguistic fractionalization were also consistent with better vaccination outcomes. CONCLUSION: Improving vaccination coverage and reducing inequalities requires that policies and programs address critical social determinants of health including geographic and social exclusion, gender inequality and the availability of financial protection for health. Further research should investigate the mechanisms contributing to these associations.","tags":["\"dtp3 coverage; developing countries; equity; healthcare disparities; mcv coverage; socioeconomic factors\""],"title":"Country-level predictors of vaccination coverage and inequalities in Gavi-supported countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Renee Carter","Jean-Frédéric Lévesque","Sam Harper","Amélie Quesnel-Vallée"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039242,"objectID":"a198e68d1e885dad1eb6516f6f28f0fe","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/carter-2017-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:22.083006Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carter-2017-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"The Family Medicine Group (FMG) model of primary care in Quebec, Canada, was driven by the voluntary implementation of family physicians.

We used data from provincial health administrative databases to identify the diabetic patient population over the age of 20 years for each fiscal year between 2003-2004 and 2011-2012. We used fixed effects and marginal structural models to estimate the effect of enrolment in FMGs on avoidable use of the ED. Our results indicated that for every 10-percentage point increase in the population enrolled with an FMG in the year prior to an event, there was a 3% reduction in avoidable visits to the ED made by an individual (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95, 0.99). We found a significant reduction among diabetic patients who had at most 1 visit to the ED per year (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.95, 0.99) and nonsignificant effects among more frequent users. Within low-enrolment regions, a 10-percentage point increase in enrolment in FMG practices at t - 1 led to an 18% decrease in the number of avoidable ED visits (RR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.78, 0.87). The effect disappeared when the analyses were restricted to the high-enrolment regions (RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.92, 1.09).

In this article, we explain the rationale for the recommendations and for the development of an improved equity monitoring tool. Gavi's previous approach to measuring equity was the difference in vaccination coverage between a country's richest and poorest wealth quintiles. In addition to the wealth index, we recommend monitoring other dimensions of vulnerability (maternal education, place of residence, child sex and the multidimensional poverty index). For dimensions with multiple subgroups, measures of inequality that consider information on all subgroups should be used. We also recommend that both absolute and relative measures of inequality be tracked over time. Finally, we propose that equity benchmarks target complete elimination of inequalities. To facilitate equity monitoring, we recommend the use of a data display tool - the equity dashboard - to support decision-making in the sustainable development period.

Our research objective is to examine disparities in colorectal cancer mortality by SES, using a scientifically rigorous and reproducible approach with publicly available online tools, HD*Calc and NCI SES Quintiles. METHODS: All reported colorectal cancer deaths in the United States from 1980 to 2010 were categorized into NCI SES quintiles and assessed at the county level. Joinpoint was used to test for significant changes in trends. Absolute and relative concentration indices (CI) were computed with HD*Calc to graph change in disparity over time. RESULTS: Disparities by SES significantly declined until 1993-1995, and then increased until 2010, due to a mortality drop in populations living in high SES areas that exceeded the mortality drop in lower SES areas. HD*Calc results were consistent for both absolute and relative concentration indices. Inequality aversion parameter weights of 2, 4, 6 and 8 were compared to explore how much colorectal cancer mortality was concentrated in the poorest quintile compared to the richest quintile. Weights larger than 4 did not increase the slope of the disparities trend. CONCLUSIONS: There is consistent evidence for a significant crossover in colorectal cancer disparity from 1980 to 2010. Trends in disparity can be accurately and readily summarized using the HD*Calc tool. The disparity trend, combined with published information on the timing of screening and treatment uptake, is concordant with the idea that introduction of medical screening and treatment leads to lower uptake in lower compared to higher SES populations and that differential uptake yields disparity in population mortality.","tags":["\"colorectal cancer mortality; concentration index; disparities; hd*calc; inequality aversion parameter; ses quintiles\""],"title":"Assessing disparities in colorectal cancer mortality by socioeconomic status using new tools: health disparities calculator and socioeconomic quintiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Catherine Arsenault","Sam Harper","Arijit Nandi","José M Mendoza Rodrı́guez","Peter M Hansen","Mira Johri"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039244,"objectID":"1f30344eac68e7b1c09c8b4374bb7e0e","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/arsenault-2017-ac/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:23.940945Z","relpermalink":"/publication/arsenault-2017-ac/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: (1) To conduct a systematic analysis of inequalities in childhood vaccination coverage in Gavi-supported countries; (2) to comparatively assess alternative measurement approaches and how they may affect cross-country comparisons of the level of inequalities. METHODS: Using the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (2005-2014) in 45 Gavi-supported countries, we measured inequalities in vaccination coverage across seven dimensions of social stratification and of vulnerability to poor health outcomes. We quantified inequalities using pairwise comparisons (risk differences and ratios) and whole spectrum measures (slope and relative indices of inequality). To contrast measurement approaches, we pooled the estimates using random-effects meta-analyses, ranked countries by the magnitude of inequality and compared agreement in country ranks. RESULTS: At the aggregate level, maternal education, multidimensional poverty, and wealth index poverty were the dimensions associated with the largest inequalities. In 36 out of 45 countries, inequalities were substantial, with a difference in coverage of 10 percentage points or more between the top and bottom of at least one of these social dimensions. Important inequalities by child sex, child malnutrition and urban/rural residence were also found in a smaller set of countries. The magnitude of inequality and ranking of countries differed across dimension and depending on the measure used. Pairwise comparisons could not be estimated in certain countries. The slope and relative indices of inequality were estimated in all countries and produced more stable country rankings, and should thus facilitate more reliable international comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in vaccination coverage persist in a large majority of Gavi-supported countries. Inequalities should be monitored across multiple dimensions of vulnerability. Using whole spectrum measures to quantify inequality across multiple ordered social groups has important advantages. We illustrate these findings using an equity dashboard designed to support decision-making in the Sustainable Development Goals period.","tags":["dtp3 coverage","developing countries","equity","healthcare disparities","mcv coverage","socioeconomic factors"],"title":"Monitoring equity in vaccination coverage: A systematic analysis of demographic and health surveys from 45 Gavi-supported countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Deepa Jahagirdar","Sam Harper","Jody Heymann","Hema Swaminathan","Arnab Mukherji","Arijit Nandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039250,"objectID":"83daa82f99558f6b3dfe88da1ad9baba","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/jahagirdar-2017-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:30.389383Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jahagirdar-2017-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Despite recent improvements, low height-for-age, a key indicator of inadequate child nutrition, is an ongoing public health issue in low-income and middle-income countries. Paid maternity leave has the potential to improve child nutrition, but few studies have estimated its impact. Methods: We used data from 583 227 children younger than 5 years in 37 countries surveyed as part of the Demographic and Health Surveys (2000-2014) to compare the change in children's height-for-age z score in five countries that increased their legislated duration of paid maternity leave (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Lesotho) relative to 32 other countries that did not. A quasiexperimental difference-in-difference design involving a linear regression of height-for-age z score on the number of weeks of legislated paid maternity leave was used. We included fixed effects for country and birth year to control for, respectively, fixed country characteristics and shared trends in height-for-age, and adjusted for time-varying covariates such as gross domestic product per capita and the female labour force participation rate. Results: The mean height-for-age z scores in the pretreatment period were -1.91 (SD=1.44) and -1.47 (SD=1.57) in countries that did and did not change their policies, respectively. The scores increased in treated and control countries over time. A 1-month increase in legislated paid maternity leave was associated with a decrease of 0.08(95% CI -0.20 to 0.04) in child height-for-age z score. Sensitivity analyses did not support a robust association between paid maternity leave policies and height-for-age z score. Conclusion: We found little evidence that recent changes in legislated paid maternity leave have been sufficient to affect child height-for-age z scores. The relatively short durations of leave, the potential for low coverage and the strong increasing trend in children's growth may explain our findings. Future studies considering longer durations or combined interventions may reveal further insight to support policy.","tags":["\"epidemiology; nutrition; other study design; prevention strategies\""],"title":"The effect of paid maternity leave on early childhood growth in low-income and middle-income countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas B King","Erin Strumpf","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039243,"objectID":"6bb3d047fd6675938f1ba0fed78a46be","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/king-2016-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:22.511659Z","relpermalink":"/publication/king-2016-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Has the Increase in Disability Insurance Participation Contributed to Increased Opioid-Related Mortality?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Paul Gray","Faisca Richer","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039243,"objectID":"aad254e7f79739f1370a97f3081dcc5f","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/gray-2016-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:23.055826Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gray-2016-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: Following the onset of intensive colonial intervention and rapid social change in the lives of Inuit people, youth in Nunavik have experienced high rates of mental health problems and suicide. Inuit people describe a broad range of contextual influences on mental wellness based on lived experience, but most epidemiological studies have focused on individual risk factors and pathologies. This study aimed to assess the influence of multiple determinants of mental wellness among Inuit youth in Nunavik, including culturally meaningful activities, housing and community social characteristics. METHODS: Mental wellness was measured in the form of two primary outcomes: self-esteem and suicidal ideation. Using cross-sectional data from the 2004 Nunavik Inuit Health Survey and multilevel regression modelling, we estimated associations between these two outcomes and various independent individual- and community-level explanatory factors among Inuit youth. All variables were selected to reflect Inuit perspectives on determinants of mental wellness. The study design and interpretation of results were validated with Inuit community representatives. RESULTS: Pride in Inuit identity, traditional activities, community-level social support and community-level socio-economic status were found to be protective. Barriers to participating in traditional activities, household crowding and high community rates of violence were risk factors. CONCLUSION: These findings support Inuit perspectives, expand the scope of epidemiological analysis of Inuit mental wellness and reinforce the need for locally informed, community-wide approaches to mental wellness promotion for Inuit youth.","tags":[],"title":"Individual- and community-level determinants of Inuit youth mental wellness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nichole Austin","Sam Harper","Erin Strumpf"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039241,"objectID":"1a9a452017920319c1ce1aa33be8208a","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/austin-2016-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:21.520463Z","relpermalink":"/publication/austin-2016-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Racial residential segregation in the United States has been linked to racial differences in birth outcomes, with studies reporting associations between segregation and birth weight. However, this relationship is likely confounded, and many individual and neighborhood-level covariates included in previous models are likely mediators, potentially obscuring any causal impact of segregation on birth weight. METHODS: We compiled a record of non-Hispanic black and white singleton births to US-born/resident mothers in 2000, linked to segregation indices at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level in the non-Southern US. Segregation was measured via the dissimilarity index. The outcomes were individual-level birth weight and the metropolitan statistical area-level black/white gap in birth weight. We instrumented for segregation using the railroad division index. We compared race-stratified ordinary least squares models to two-stage least squares models, with cluster robust standard errors. RESULTS: We estimated a 1.2 g decrease in black birth weight for every one-percentage point increase in segregation (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.9, -0.50) via ordinary least squares but a 2.8 g decrease (95% CI: -6.0, 0.48) using two-stage least squares. For white infants, our ordinary least squares estimate was 0.53 (95% CI: -0.23, 1.3), and our two-stage least squares estimate was in the opposite direction (-0.68, 95% CI: -3.5, 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Ordinary least squares estimates may understate the effect of segregation on birth weight in blacks. Evidence from instrumental variable models was consistent with a causal impact of segregation on black birth outcomes, but estimates were imprecise and may be affected by weak instrument bias.","tags":[],"title":"Does Segregation Lead to Lower Birth Weight?: An Instrumental Variable Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nichole Austin","Sam Harper","Jay S Kaufman","Ghassan B Hamra"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039240,"objectID":"fc117c3b047ab3f129a48b4472f7d210","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/austin-2016-ab/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:20.370531Z","relpermalink":"/publication/austin-2016-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Replication is a vital part of the research process and has recently received considerable attention. Analyses using publicly available data should, if adequately described, be reproducible without assistance from the original investigators. Using data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a recent study reported a statistically significant difference in cardiovascular disease risk comparing subgroups of sexual minority men. We attempted to reproduce these findings and assessed whether the results were robust to alternative analytic strategies and assumptions. METHODS: We used the exclusion criteria and coding strategy described in the original paper to construct our analytical data set. Sampling weights were constructed in accordance with NHANES analytical guidelines. We estimated crude and covariate-adjusted associations between sexual orientation and vascular age using the regression models specified in the original report. We also conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to improve on the original findings. RESULTS: Our replication attempt was partially successful: we replicated the general trends reported in the original analysis, but not identical effect estimates. Importantly, we identified a potential misapplication of the Framingham Risk Score; correcting for this increased the probability that the reported null hypothesis test was a type I error. CONCLUSIONS: This paper supports the recent calls for greater transparency and improved reporting in research. Even with a publicly available and well-documented data source, we were unable to exactly replicate another study's original findings. Our sensitivity analyses revealed key issues in the original analysis and demonstrate the scientific importance of research replication.","tags":["\"cardiovascular disease; health inequalities; public health\""],"title":"Challenges in reproducing results from publicly available data: an example of sexual orientation and cardiovascular disease risk","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas J Charters","Sam Harper","Erin C Strumpf","S V Subramanian","Mariana Arcaya","Arijit Nandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039242,"objectID":"32590bc6456266ee4583a41433bca24c","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/charters-2016-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:21.885916Z","relpermalink":"/publication/charters-2016-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"The recent housing crisis offers the opportunity to understand the effects of unique indicators of macroeconomic conditions on health.

For our analyses, we used data from the Demographic and Household Surveys (DHS) from 57 countries conducted between 1999 and 2013. Our analyses focus on height-for-age z scores (HAZ) for children under 5 years of age who were surveyed as part of the DHS. To identify the causal effect of minimum wages, we utilized plausibly exogenous variation in the legislated minimum wages during each child's year of birth, the identifying assumption being that mothers do not time their births around changes in the minimum wage. As a sensitivity exercise, we also made within family comparisons (mother fixed effect models). Our final analysis on 49 countries reveal that a 1% increase in minimum wages was associated with 0.1% (95% CI = -0.2, 0) decrease in HAZ scores. Adverse effects of an increase in the minimum wage were observed among girls and for children of fathers who were less than 35 years old, mothers aged 20-29, parents who were married, parents who were less educated, and parents involved in manual work. We also explored heterogeneity by region and GDP per capita at baseline (1999). Adverse effects were concentrated in lower-income countries and were most pronounced in South Asia. By contrast, increases in the minimum wage improved children's HAZ in Latin America, and among children of parents working in a skilled sector. Our findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that increases in the minimum wage unconditionally improve child health in lower-income countries, and highlight heterogeneity in the impact of minimum wages around the globe.

Access to daycare might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women, improve education for girls caring for younger siblings, and promote nutrition and learning among children. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of daycare programs in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. This cluster-randomized trial will estimate the effect of a community-based daycare program on health and economic well-being over the life-course among women and children living in rural Rajasthan, India. METHODS: This three-year study takes place in rural communities from five blocks in the Udaipur District of rural Rajasthan. The intervention is the introduction of a full-time, affordable, community-based daycare program. At baseline, 3177 mothers with age eligible children living in 160 village hamlets were surveyed. After the baseline, these hamlets were randomized to the intervention or control groups and respondents will be interviewed on two more occasions. Primary social and economic outcomes include women's economic status and economic opportunity, women's empowerment, and children's educational attainment. Primary health outcomes include women's mental health, as well as children's nutritional status. DISCUSSION: This interdisciplinary research initiative will provide rigorous evidence concerning the effects of daycare in lower-income settings. In doing so it will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the daycare system in India in ways that promote health and economic well-being.

Meta-regression was used to assess whether variation in the magnitude of NMR inequalities was associated with inequalities in coverage of maternal health services, and whether country-level economic and health system factors were associated with mean NMR and socioeconomic inequality in NMR. RESULTS: Of the three maternal health service indicators examined, the magnitude of socioeconomic inequality in NMR was most strongly related to inequalities in antenatal care. NMR inequality was greatest in countries with higher out-of-pocket health expenditures, more doctors per capita, and a higher adolescent fertility rate. Determinants of lower mean NMR (e.g., higher government health expenditures and a greater number of nurses/midwives per capita) differed from factors associated with lower NMR inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the financial burden of maternal health services and achieving universal coverage of antenatal care may contribute to a reduction in socioeconomic differences in NMR. Further investigation of the mechanisms contributing to these cross-national associations seems warranted.","tags":["\"low- and middle-income countries; maternal health services; meta-regression; neonatal mortality; socioeconomic inequality\""],"title":"Do Socioeconomic Inequalities in Neonatal Mortality Reflect Inequalities in Coverage of Maternal Health Services?

We examined the relationships of different walkability measures to biosensor-assessed total walking (i.e., steps/day) in adults with type 2 diabetes living in Montreal (QC, Canada). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (60.5$±$10.4 years; 48.1% women) were recruited through McGill University-affiliated clinics (June 2006 to May 2008). Steps/day were assessed once per season for one year with pedometers. Neighbourhood walkability was evaluated through participant reports, in-field audits, Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-derived measures, and the Walk Score®. Relationships between walkability and daily steps were estimated using Bayesian longitudinal hierarchical linear regression models (n = 131). RESULTS: Participants who reported living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods completed 1345 more steps/day (95% Credible Interval: 718, 1976; Quartiles 4 versus 1). Those living in the most compared to the least walkable neighbourhoods (based on GIS-derived walkability) completed 606 more steps per day (95% CrI: 8, 1203). No statistically significant associations with steps were observed for audit-assessed walkability or the Walk Score®.

We used birth history data collected via Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to assemble a multilevel panel of 258,769 live births in 20 countries from 2001 to 2008; these data were merged with longitudinal information on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) weeks of paid maternity leave guaranteed by each country. We used Logistic regression models that included country and year fixed effects to estimate the impact of increases in FTE paid maternity leave policies in the prior year on the receipt of the following vaccines: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) commonly given at birth, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP, 3 doses) commonly given in clinic visits and Polio (3 doses) given in clinic visits or as part of campaigns. We found that extending the duration of paid maternity leave had a positive effect on immunization rates for all three doses of the DTP vaccine; each additional FTE week of paid maternity leave increased DTP1, 2 and 3 coverage by 1.38 (95% CI = 1.18, 1.57), 1.62 (CI = 1.34, 1.91) and 2.17 (CI = 1.76, 2.58) percentage points, respectively. Estimates were robust to adjustment for birth characteristics, household-level covariates, attendance of skilled health personnel at birth and time-varying country-level covariates.

Using a constrained regression approach (with the first 2 periods' effects constrained to zero), Kramer et al. find evidence that age and cohort effects figure more prominently than do period effects in contributing to relative black-white mortality differences, and they argue that early-life exposures should be given greater consideration for mitigation of racial differences in heart disease. In this invited commentary, I argue that the utility of age-period-cohort models for understanding health inequalities depends on the plausibility of the assumptions used to break the link between the 3 factors. Based on the existing age-period-cohort literature, alternative assumptions seem likely to produce substantially different results. I also argue that interpretations of the impacts of age, period, and cohort effects on racial inequalities in heart disease mortality may depend on whether inequalities are assessed on the absolute scale or the relative scale.

The rationale for our study was to provide more robust evidence by using a quasi-experimental design. METHODS: We analysed 955,561 suicides occurring in the USA from 1980 to 2010 and used a broad index of economic activity in each US state to measure economic conditions. We used a quasi-experimental, fixed-effects design and we also assessed whether the effects were heterogeneous by demographic group and during periods of official recession. RESULTS: After accounting for secular trends, seasonality and unmeasured fixed characteristics of states, we found that an economic downturn similar in magnitude to the 2007 Great Recession increased suicide mortality by 0.14 deaths per 100,000 population [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00, 0.28] or around 350 deaths. Effects were stronger for men (0.28, 95% CI 0.07, 0.49) than women and for those with less than 12 years of education (1.22 95% CI 0.83, 1.60) compared with more than 12 years of education. The overall effect did not differ for recessionary (0.11, 95% CI -0.02, 0.25) vs non-recessionary periods (0.15, 95% CI 0.01, 0.29). The main study limitation is the potential for misclassified death certificates and we cannot definitively rule out unmeasured confounding.

In an effort to increase coverage of skilled delivery care and reduce socioeconomic inequalities, governments of several countries in sub-Saharan Africa have recently adopted policies that remove user fees for facility-based delivery services. There is little rigorous evidence of the impact of these policies and few studies have examined effects on socioeconomic inequalities. This study investigates the impact of recent delivery fee exemption policies in Ghana, Senegal, and Sierra Leone on socioeconomic differences in the use of facility-based delivery services. Using Demographic and Health Survey data from nine sub-Saharan African countries, we evaluated the user fee policy changes using a difference-in-differences approach that accounts for underlying common secular trends and time invariant differences among countries, and allows for differential effects of the policy by socioeconomic position. Removing user fees was consistent with meaningful increases in facility deliveries across all categories of household wealth and maternal education. We found little evidence of differential effects of removing user fees across quartiles of household wealth, with increases of 5.4 facility deliveries per hundred live births (95% CI: 2.1, 8.8) among women in the poorest quartile and 6.8 per hundred live births (95% CI: 4.0, 9.7) for women in the richest quartile. However, our results suggest that educated women benefited more from removing user fees compared to women with no education. For women with at least some secondary education, the estimated effect was 8.6 facility deliveries per hundred live births (95% CI: 5.4, 11.9), but only 4.6 per hundred live births (95% CI: 2.2, 7.0) for women with no education (heterogeneity p-value = 0.04). Thus, while removing fees at the point of service increased facility deliveries across the socioeconomic gradient, it did not reduce inequalities defined by household wealth and may have contributed to a widening of educational inequalities. These findings emphasize the need for concerted efforts to address financial and other barriers that contribute to large and persistent socioeconomic inequalities in delivery care.

There is little rigorous evidence of the impact of these policies on utilization of delivery services and no evaluations have examined effects on neonatal mortality rates (NMR). In this article, we estimate the causal effect of removing user fees on the proportion of births delivered in facilities, the proportion of births delivered by Caesarean section, and NMR. METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 10 African countries between 1997 and 2012. Kenya, Ghana and Senegal adopted policies removing user fees for facility-based deliveries between 2003 and 2007, while seven other countries not changing user fee policies were used as controls. We used a difference-in-differences (DD) regression approach to control for secular trends in the outcomes that are common across countries and for time invariant differences between countries. RESULTS: According to covariate-adjusted DD models, the policy change was consistent with an increase of 3.1 facility-based deliveries per 100 live births (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 5.2) and an estimated reduction of 2.9 neonatal deaths per 1000 births (95% CI: -6.8, 1.0). In relative terms, this corresponds to a 5% increase in facility deliveries and a 9% reduction in NMR. There was no evidence of an increase in Caesarean deliveries. We examined lead and lag-time effects, finding evidence that facility deliveries continued to increase following fee removal. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest removing user fees increased facility-based deliveries and possibly contributed to a reduction in NMR.

The programme, called AUGE, defines legally enforceable rights to explicit healthcare benefits for priority health conditions, which incrementally covered 56 problems representing 75% of the disease burden between 2005 and 2009. It was accompanied by other health reform measures to increase public financing and public sector planning to secure the guarantees nationwide, as well as the state's stewardship role. We analysed data from household surveys conducted before and after the AUGE reform to estimate changes in levels of unmet health need, defined as the lack of a healthcare visit for a health problem occurring in the last 30 days, by age, sex, income, education, health insurance, residence and ethnicity; fitting logistic regression models and using predictive margins. The overall prevalence of unmet health need was much lower in 2009 (17.6%, 95% CI: 16.5%, 18.6%) than in 2000 (30.0%, 95% CI: 28.3%, 31.7%). Differences by income and education extremes and rural-urban residence disappeared. In 2009, people who had been in treatment for a condition covered by AUGE in the past year had a lower adjusted prevalence of unmet need for their recent problem (11.7%, 95% CI: 10.5%, 13.2%) than who had not (21.0%, 95% CI: 19.6%, 22.4%). Despite limitations including cross-sectional and self-reported data, our findings suggest that the Chilean health system has become more equitable and responsive to need. While these changes cannot be directly attributed to AUGE, they were coincident with the AUGE reforms. However, healthcare equity concerns are still present, relating to quality of care, health system barriers and differential access for health conditions that are not covered by AUGE.

METHODS: We linked data from the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey with facility data from the 2008 Ethiopian National EmONC Needs Assessment based on geographical coordinates collected in both surveys. Health facilities were classified based on the performance of nine EmONC signal functions (e.g. neonatal resuscitation, Caesarean section). We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the relationship between distance to services and early neonatal mortality. A decomposition approach was used to quantify the relative contributions of distance to EmONC services and other determinants to overall and socio-economic inequality in early neonatal mortality. RESULTS: In general, closer proximity to EmONC services and higher level of care were associated with lower early neonatal mortality. Living more than 80 km from the nearest comprehensive EmONC facility able to perform all nine signal functions compared to living within 10 km was associated with an increase of 14.4 early neonatal deaths per 1000 live births (95% CI: 0.1, 28.7). Closer proximity to a substandard EmONC facility compared with no facility was not associated with lower early neonatal mortality. Distance to EmONC services was an important determinant of early neonatal mortality, although it did not make a significant contribution to explaining socio-economic inequality.

It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, providing objective data that are then interpreted using normative judgments about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable. METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight assigned to the variables being measured. FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same underlying data,we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss the normative judgments underlying their measures.

To this effect, the advantages of using simulation models over other population health intervention research methods are discussed. Key questions regarding the potential challenges of developing simulation models to investigate population health intervention research on reducing social inequalities in health and the types of population health intervention research questions that can be answered using this methodology are reviewed. We use the example of social inequalities in coronary heart disease to illustrate how simulation models can elucidate the effectiveness of a number of 'what-if' counterfactual population health interventions on reducing social inequalities in coronary heart disease.

Our aim was to produce comparable estimates of changes in socioeconomic inequalities in NMR in the past two decades across these countries. METHODS: We used data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for countries in which a survey was done in 2008 or later and one about 10 years previously. We measured absolute inequalities with the slope index of inequality and relative inequalities with the relative index of inequality. We used an asset-based wealth index and maternal education as measures of socioeconomic position and summarised inequality estimates for all included countries with random-effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: 24 low-income and middle-income countries were eligible for inclusion. In most countries, absolute and relative wealth-related and educational inequalities in NMR decreased between survey 1 and survey 2. In five countries (Cameroon, Nigeria, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda), the difference in NMR between the top and bottom of the wealth distribution was reduced by more than two neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year. By contrast, wealth-related inequality increased by more than 1·5 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths per year in Ethiopia and Cambodia. Patterns of change in absolute and relative educational inequalities in NMR were similar to those of wealth-related NMR inequalities, although the size of educational inequalities tended to be slightly larger. INTERPRETATION: Socioeconomic inequality in NMR seems to have decreased in the past two decades in most countries of low and middle income.

METHODS: We estimated the effect of the local unemployment rate on health behaviours using pooled annual surveys from the 2003-2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys, as well as population-based telephone surveys of the US adult general population. Analyses were based on approximately 1 million respondents aged 25 years or older living in 90 Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Metropolitan Divisions (MMSAs). The primary exposure was the quarterly MMSA-specific unemployment rate. Outcomes included alcohol consumption, smoking status, attempts to quit smoking, body mass index, overweight/obesity and past-month physical activity or exercise. RESULTS: The average unemployment rate across MMSAs increased from a low of 4.5% in 2007 to a high of 9.3% in 2010. In multivariable models accounting for individual-level sociodemographic characteristics and MMSA and quarter fixed effects, a one percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with 0.15 (95% CI -0.31 to 0.01) fewer drinks consumed in the past month and a 0.14 (95% CI -0.28 to 0.00) percentage-point decrease in the prevalence of past-month heavy drinking; these effects were driven primarily by men. Changes in the unemployment rate were not consistently associated with other health behaviours.

METHODS: An electronic search of studies assessing socioeconomic inequalities in health using a simulation model was conducted. Characteristics of the simulation models were extracted and distinct simulation approaches were identified. As an illustration, a simple agent-based model of the emergence of socioeconomic differences in alcohol abuse was developed. RESULTS: We found 61 studies published between 1989 and 2013. Ten different simulation approaches were identified. The agent-based model illustration showed that multilevel, reciprocal and indirect effects of social determinants on health can be modeled flexibly.

The review and the simulation model example suggest that the use of simulation models may enhance the understanding and debate about existing and new socioeconomic inequalities of health frameworks.","tags":[],"title":"Simulation models for socioeconomic inequalities in health: a systematic review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper","Eric Ruder","Henry A Roman","Amelia Geggel","Onyemaechi Nweke","Devon Payne-Sturges","Jonathan I Levy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1375315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039234,"objectID":"3c2e1dc717ddffb8c335258d2f114880","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2013-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:14.215857Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2013-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Formally evaluating how specific policy measures influence environmental justice is challenging, especially in the context of regulatory analyses in which quantitative comparisons are the norm. However, there is a large literature on developing and applying quantitative measures of health inequality in other settings, and these measures may be applicable to environmental regulatory analyses. In this paper, we provide information to assist policy decision makers in determining the viability of using measures of health inequality in the context of environmental regulatory analyses. We conclude that quantification of the distribution of inequalities in health outcomes across social groups of concern, considering both within-group and between-group comparisons, would be consistent with both the structure of regulatory analysis and the core definition of environmental justice. Appropriate application of inequality indicators requires thorough characterization of the baseline distribution of exposures and risks, leveraging data generally available within regulatory analyses. Multiple inequality indicators may be applicable to regulatory analyses, and the choice among indicators should be based on explicit value judgments regarding the dimensions of environmental justice of greatest interest.

Determinants included individual socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, urban residence, education, marital status, household income, self-rated health, health care use, satisfaction with health care system) and country-level characteristics [gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, disability-free life expectancy, equality in child mortality, income inequality, health and public health expenditures]. We used logistic regression to assess the likelihood that individuals ranked minimizing inequalities first, and rank-ordered logistic regression to compare the ranking of other priorities against minimizing health inequalities. Individuals tended to prioritize health system goals related to overall improvement (improving population health and health care responsiveness) over those related to equality and fairness (minimizing inequalities in health and responsiveness, and promoting fairness of financial contribution). Individuals in countries with higher GDP per capita, life expectancy, and equality in child mortality were more likely to prioritize minimizing health inequalities.

How these changes affect the mental health of older adults is largely unknown. METHODS: We use data from the 2002-2003 World Health Surveys for 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa to examine whether older adults who may be lacking adequate support through living alone or in skipped-generation households are at an increased risk of depressive symptoms compared to those living with at least one working-age adult. Using meta-regression, we also examine whether heterogeneity across countries in the prevalence of depressive symptoms or in the association between living arrangements and depressive symptoms is associated with HIV/AIDS prevalence and national economic status. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms among older adults was 9.2%. Older adults living alone had a 2.3% point higher predicted prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to individuals living with at least one working-age adult (95% confidence interval: 0.2%, 4.4%). None of the country characteristics examined explained heterogeneity across countries in the relationship between living arrangements and depressive symptoms. However, there was some evidence suggesting a positive association between depressive symptom prevalence and the severity of a country's HIV/AIDS epidemic. CONCLUSION: As depressive symptoms are known to be predictive of poor quality of life and increased mortality, it is important to address how health and social policies can be put in place to mitigate the potentially detrimental effects of solitary living on the mental health of older persons in sub-Saharan Africa.","tags":[],"title":"The relationship of living arrangements and depressive symptoms among older adults in sub-Saharan Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper","Nicholas B King"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039233,"objectID":"b126378d59265b503beaf6ebd2265846","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2013-ac/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:13.029908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2013-ac/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Commentary: best practice for what?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amelia Maika","Murthy N Mittinty","Sally Brinkman","Sam Harper","Elan Satriawan","John W Lynch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039235,"objectID":"d020508941da79864a53233269efa72f","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/maika-2013-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:14.99405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maika-2013-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Measuring social inequalities in health is common; however, research examining inequalities in child cognitive function is more limited. We investigated household expenditure-related inequality in children's cognitive function in Indonesia in 2000 and 2007, the contributors to inequality in both time periods, and changes in the contributors to cognitive function inequalities between the periods. METHODS: Data from the 2000 and 2007 round of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) were used. Study participants were children aged 7-14 years (n = 6179 and n = 6680 in 2000 and 2007, respectively). The relative concentration index (RCI) was used to measure the magnitude of inequality. Contribution of various contributors to inequality was estimated by decomposing the concentration index in 2000 and 2007. Oaxaca-type decomposition was used to estimate changes in contributors to inequality between 2000 and 2007. RESULTS: Expenditure inequality decreased by 45% from an RCI = 0.29 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.36) in 2000 to 0.16 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.20) in 2007 but the burden of poorer cognitive function was higher among the disadvantaged in both years. The largest contributors to inequality in child cognitive function were inequalities in per capita expenditure, use of improved sanitation and maternal high school attendance. Changes in maternal high school participation (27%), use of improved sanitation (25%) and per capita expenditures (18%) were largely responsible for the decreasing inequality in children's cognitive function between 2000 and 2007.

Whether inequalities are measured on the absolute (difference) or relative (ratio) scale can have a significant impact on judgments about whether health inequalities are increasing or decreasing, but both of these measures are not often presented in empirical studies. In this study we investigated the impact of selective presentation of health inequality measures on judgments of health inequality trends among 40 university undergraduates. We randomized participants to see either a difference or ratio measure of health inequality alongside raw mortality rates in 5 different scenarios. At baseline there were no differences between treatment groups in assessments of inequality trends, but selective exposure to the same raw data augmented with ratio versus difference inequality graphs altered participants' assessments of inequality change. When absolute inequality decreased and relative inequality increased, exposure to ratio measures increased the probability of concluding that inequality had increased from 32.5% to 70%, but exposure to difference measures did not (35% vs. 25%). Selective exposure to ratio versus difference inequality graphs thus increased the difference between groups in concluding that inequality had increased from 2.5% (95% CI -9.5% to 14.5%) to 45% (95% CI 29.4 to 60.6). A similar pattern was evident for other scenarios where absolute and relative inequality trends gave conflicting results. In cases where measures of absolute and relative inequality both increased or both decreased, we did not find any evidence that assignment to ratio vs. difference graphs had an impact on assessments of inequality change. Selective reporting of measures of health inequality has the potential to create biased judgments of progress in ameliorating health inequalities.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of selective evidence presentation on judgments of health inequality trends: an experimental study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert W Platt","Sam B Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039231,"objectID":"bd383a44e8a8ff3c9d88326712551870","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/platt-2013-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:11.667787Z","relpermalink":"/publication/platt-2013-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Survey data with sampling weights: is there a \\\"best\\\" approach?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathalie Auger","Alison L Park","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039230,"objectID":"2862ae41e183b2f14166d5f23bb41b42","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/auger-2012-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:09.872664Z","relpermalink":"/publication/auger-2012-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated temporal and regional inequalities in adverse birth outcomes between Anglophones and Francophones of a Canadian province.

The prevalence of current daily smoking, low fruit and vegetable consumption, physical inactivity, and heavy episodic alcohol drinking were quantified and compared across wealth and education levels in low- and middle-income country groups. METHODS: This study included self-reported data from 232,056 adult participants in 48 countries, derived from the 2002-2004 World Health Survey. Data were stratified by sex and low- or middle-income country status. The main outcome measurements were risk factor prevalence rates reported by wealth quintile and five levels of educational attainment. Socioeconomic inequalities were measured using the slope index of inequality, reflecting differences in prevalence rates, and the relative index of inequality, reflecting the prevalence ratio between the two extremes of wealth or education accounting for the entire distribution. Data were adjusted for confounding factors: sex, age, marital status, area of residence, and country of residence. RESULTS: Smoking and low fruit and vegetable consumption were significantly higher among lower socioeconomic groups. The highest wealth-related absolute inequality was seen in smoking among men of low- income country group (slope index of inequality 23.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval 19.6, 26.4). The slope index of inequality for low fruit and vegetable consumption across the entire distribution of education was around 8 percentage points in both sexes and both country income groups. Physical inactivity was less prevalent in populations of low socioeconomic status, especially in low-income countries (relative index of inequality: (men) 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.33, 0.64; (women) 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.42, 0.65). Mixed patterns were found for heavy drinking.

The gender differential has steadily increased over time, reaching a peak of more than 8 years in 1980s, and decreased thereafter to 6.7 years in 2005. Studies to investigate the pattern and contributing factors to changes in the life expectancy gender gap have been mostly from Western countries, and there has been no such study in Asian countries, except in Japan. We therefore aimed to examine age- and cause-specific contributions to the changing gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea, in particular the decline of the gap, using a decomposition method. Between 1970 and 1979 when the gender gap in life expectancy widened, faster mortality decline among women in ages 20-44 explained 66% of the total increase in the gender gap, which would be due to substantial improvements in reproductive health among women and excess male mortality in occupational injuries and transport accidents. Although greater survival advantage among elderly women over 70 contributed to further increase in the gender gap, the contributions from younger ages with the ages 15-64 contributing the most (-2 years) resulted in the overall reduction of the gender gap which began in 1992 and continued to 2005. Among causes of death, liver diseases (-0.5 years, 38% of the total decline), transport accidents (-0.4 years, 31%), hypertensive diseases (-0.3 years, 19%), stroke (-0.1 years, 11%), and tuberculosis (-0.1 years) contributed the most to the overall 1.4 years reduction in the gender gap. However, changes in mortality from lung cancer (+0.3 years), suicide (+0.3 years), chronic lower respiratory diseases (+0.2 years), and ischemic heart diseases (+0.1 years) contributed to widening the gap during the same period. In sum, while smoking-related causes of death have contributed most to the narrowing gap in most other industrialized countries, these causes contributed toward increasing the gender gap in Korea. Instead, liver disease, hypertension-related diseases, and transport accidents were major contributing causes of death to the narrowing of gender differentials in life expectancy in Korea.","tags":[],"title":"The changing gender differences in life expectancy in Korea 1970-2005","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas B King","Sam Harper","Meredith E Young"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1346457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039231,"objectID":"15966d815a153880eceac15155a4b926","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/king-2012-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:11.302119Z","relpermalink":"/publication/king-2012-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency of reporting of absolute and relative effect measures in health inequalities research.

This study quantified and compared education- and wealth-based inequalities in the prevalence of five noncommunicable diseases (angina, arthritis, asthma, depression and diabetes) and comorbidity in low- and middle-income country groups. METHODS: Using 2002-04 World Health Survey data from 41 low- and middle-income countries, the prevalence estimates of angina, arthritis, asthma, depression, diabetes and comorbidity in adults aged 18 years or above are presented for wealth quintiles and five education levels, by sex and country income group. Symptom-based classification was used to determine angina, arthritis, asthma and depression rates, and diabetes diagnoses were self-reported. Socioeconomic inequalities according to wealth and education were measured absolutely, using the slope index of inequality, and relatively, using the relative index of inequality. RESULTS: Wealth and education inequalities were more pronounced in the low-income country group than the middle-income country group. Both wealth and education were inversely associated with angina, arthritis, asthma, depression and comorbidity prevalence, with strongest inequalities reported for angina, asthma and comorbidity. Diabetes prevalence was positively associated with wealth and, to a lesser extent, education. Adjustments for confounding variables tended to decrease the magnitude of the inequality.

This report covers the health status and epidemiological capacity in the North American region (USA and Canada). METHODS: We assessed data from country-specific sources to identify health priorities and areas of greatest need for modifiable risk factors. We examined inequalities in health as a function of social deprivation. We also reviewed information on epidemiological capacity building and scientific contributions by epidemiologists in the region. FINDINGS: The USA and Canada enjoy technologically advanced healthcare systems that, in principle, prioritize preventive services. Both countries experience a life expectancy at birth that is higher than the global mean. Health indicator measures are consistently worse in the USA than in Canada for many outcomes, although typically by only marginal amounts. Socio-economic and racial/ethnic disparities in indicators exist for many diseases and risk factors in the USA. To a lesser extent, these social inequalities also exist in Canada, particularly among the Aboriginal populations. Epidemiology is a well-established discipline in the region, with many degree-granting schools, societies and job opportunities in the public and private sectors. North American epidemiologists have made important contributions in disease control and prevention and provide nearly a third of the global scientific output via published papers. CONCLUSIONS: Critical challenges for North American epidemiologists include social determinants of disease distribution and the underlying inequalities in access to and benefit from preventive services and healthcare, particularly in the USA. The gains in life expectancy also underscore the need for research on health promotion and prevention of disease and disability in older adults. The diversity in epidemiological subspecialties poses new challenges in training and accreditation and has occurred in parallel with a decrease in research funding.","tags":[],"title":"Burden of disease, health indicators and challenges for epidemiology in North America","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hailey R Banack","Sam Harper","Jay S Kaufman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1330560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039229,"objectID":"65bd838a7f0f427f94d3a3ee55efd4b2","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/banack-2012-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:09.547098Z","relpermalink":"/publication/banack-2012-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Coronary heart disease risk factors and mortality","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper","Erin C Strumpf","Jay S Kaufman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1330560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039228,"objectID":"907a9db896b92c6654cac0831b7698af","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2012-ae/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:08.463859Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2012-ae/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To replicate a prior study that found greater adolescent marijuana use in states that have passed medical marijuana laws (MMLs), and extend this analysis by accounting for confounding by unmeasured state characteristics and measurement error.

METHODS: We used data from 50 countries that participated in the World Health Surveys in 2002-2003. We measured two aspects of smoking: current smoking prevalence and accumulated pack-years of smoking. We used an asset-based approach to estimate permanent income. We measured absolute inequalities, separately by gender, across the entire socioeconomic distribution by using the concentration index and summarized the results and explored heterogeneity by meta-analysis. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of current smoking was highest in Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, and Europe, and lowest in Africa. Pack-years among current male smokers were highest in Europe. Wealthier men were generally less likely to be current smokers in all regions. However, there was substantial heterogeneity within each region, and in some countries (Georgia, Mexico, Mauritania) current smoking was greater among the more advantaged. Among currently smoking men socioeconomic differences for pack-years of smoking were generally much weaker than for smoking prevalence. Among women the concentration index in current smoking was largest and favored the poor in Europe (1.4, 95% CI 0.8, 2.1) but favored the rich in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. National income was generally not associated with the magnitude of socioeconomic gradients. CONCLUSIONS: In low and middle-income countries there is substantial between and within-region heterogeneity in socioeconomic inequality in tobacco exposure that is not explained by national income.

METHODS: We analyzed Quebec mortality data for three 4-year periods from 1989-2004. Differences in life expectancy at birth between the most- and least-deprived areas in each period and over time were decomposed by age and cause of death for men and women using the Arriaga method. RESULTS: Life expectancy increased for all areas, but the increase was smaller in deprived areas. Cancer, heart disease and unintentional injuries accounted for the largest shares of inequality in each period. Among women, the widening life expectancy gap was largely due to increased lung cancer mortality. Among men, mortality from HIV was an important cause of widening inequality. Increasing inequality in both sexes was offset by a decrease in mortality from unintentional injuries in deprived areas (narrowing the gap between the most- and least-deprived areas). The largest share of inequality among women was due to deaths in the 65-and-over age group. Among men, the largest share shifted over time from middle-age to the 65-and-over age group.

Despite current global prevention efforts, many low- and middle-income countries continue reporting low VCT levels. Little is known about the association of within- and between-country socioeconomic inequalities and VCT. Based on the 'inverse equity hypothesis,' this study examines the degree to which low socioeconomic groups in developing countries are disadvantaged in VCT. METHODS: Using recently released data from the 2002 to 2003 World Health Survey (WHS) for 106 705 individuals in 49 countries, this study used multilevel logistic regression to examine the association of individual- and national-level factors with VCT, and whether national economic development moderated the association between individual income and VCT. Individual income was based on country-specific income quintiles. National economic development was based on national gross domestic product per capita (GDP/c). Effect modification was evaluated with the likelihood ratio test (G(2)). Individuals eligible for the VCT question of the WHS were adults between the ages of 18-49 years; women who had given birth in the last 2 years were excluded from this question. RESULTS: VCT was more likely among higher income quintiles and in countries with higher GDP/c. GDP/c moderated the association between individual income and VCT whereby relative income differences in VCT were greater in countries with lower GDP/c (G(2)= 9.21; P= 0.002). Individual socio-demographic characteristics were also associated with the likelihood of a person having VCT. CONCLUSIONS: Relative socioeconomic inequalities in VCT coverage appear to decline when higher SES groups reach a certain level of coverage. These findings suggest that changes to international VCT programs may be necessary to moderate the relative VCT differences between high- and low-income individuals in lower GDP/c nations.","tags":[],"title":"Global income-related inequalities in HIV testing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nathalie Auger","Philippe Gamache","Jessica Adam-Smith","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1309478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039226,"objectID":"d222fa3ec276fb7e06cc8975490b79b2","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/auger-2011-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:06.529801Z","relpermalink":"/publication/auger-2011-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To evaluate relative and absolute relationships between preterm birth (PTB) and neighborhood education over time.

Analyses also assessed effect modification of the association between income and non-use by female literacy. Effect modification was evaluated with the likelihood ratio test (G(2)). We found that within countries, individual age, education, urban residence and household income were associated with lack of maternal health care. National female literacy modified the association of household income with lack of maternal health care use. The strength of the association between income and lack of maternal health care was weaker in countries with higher female literacy. We conclude therefore that higher national levels of female literacy may reduce income-related inequalities in use through a range of possible mechanisms, including women's increased labour participation and higher status in society. National policies that are able to address female literacy and women's status in sub-Saharan Africa may help reduce income-related inequalities in maternal health care use.","tags":[],"title":"National female literacy, individual socio-economic status, and maternal health care use in sub-Saharan Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicholas B King","Jay S Kaufman","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1288569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039224,"objectID":"4a366bf5d54df4e1531d3d351580d2c5","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/king-2010-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:04.285576Z","relpermalink":"/publication/king-2010-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Relative measures alone tell only part of the story","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Niko Speybroeck","Peter Konings","John Lynch","Sam Harper","Dirk Berkvens","Vincent Lorant","Andrea Geckova","Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1280620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039223,"objectID":"edb5625af7447ffbe6116215090fff22","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/speybroeck-2010-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:02.750658Z","relpermalink":"/publication/speybroeck-2010-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Decomposing socioeconomic health inequalities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seungmi Yang","Young-Ho Khang","Sam Harper","George Davey Smith","David A Leon","John Lynch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1272672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039223,"objectID":"b36682ee1d1ac07f440711aca220fc49","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/yang-2010-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:03.054848Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-2010-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: We assessed life expectancy increases in the past several decades in South Korea by age and specific causes of death. METHODS: We applied Arriaga's decomposition method to life table data (1970-2005) and mortality statistics (1983-2005) to estimate age- and cause-specific contributions to changes in life expectancy. RESULTS: Reductions in infant mortality made the largest age-group contribution to the life expectancy increase. Reductions in cardiovascular diseases (particularly stroke and hypertensive diseases) contributed most to longer life expectancy between 1983 and 2005 (30% in males and 28% in females). Lower rates of stomach cancer, liver disease, tuberculosis, and external-cause mortality accounted for 30% of the male and 20% of the female increase in longevity. However, higher mortality from ischemic heart disease, lung and bronchial cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, diabetes, and suicide offset gains by 10% in both genders.

It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, providing objective data that are then interpreted using normative judgments about whether a particular distribution of health is just, fair, or socially acceptable. METHODS: We discuss five examples in which normative judgments play a role in the measurement process itself, through either the selection of one measurement strategy to the exclusion of others or the selection of the type, significance, or weight assigned to the variables being measured. FINDINGS: Overall, we find that many commonly used measures of inequality are value laden and that the normative judgments implicit in these measures have important consequences for interpreting and responding to health inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Because values implicit in the generation of health inequality measures may lead to radically different interpretations of the same underlying data, we urge researchers to explicitly consider and transparently discuss the normative judgments underlying their measures. We also urge policymakers and other consumers of health inequalities data to pay close attention to the measures on which they base their assessments of current and future health policies.","tags":[],"title":"Implicit value judgments in the measurement of health inequalities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Konings","Sam Harper","John Lynch","Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor","Dirk Berkvens","Vincent Lorant","Andrea Geckova","Niko Speybroeck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1264982400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039222,"objectID":"2c1221a6901c62a503b047096fa51825","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/konings-2010-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:02.150594Z","relpermalink":"/publication/konings-2010-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of socioeconomic health inequalities using the concentration index","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Spencer Moore","Justin N Hall","Sam Harper","John W Lynch"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039224,"objectID":"bb9293da4e69098e40d2ea9f61ba8331","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/moore-2010-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:04.0132Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moore-2010-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on 10-year risk of CHD (from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Epidemiological Follow-Up study 1971 to 1982), prevalence of major CHD risk factors (from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2004), and HP2010 targets for CHD risk factors (reduction of smoking rate to 12%, hypertension to 14%, high cholesterol levels to 17%, diabetes to 2.5%, and obesity to 15%) were used to estimate effects of different scenarios on population levels and social disparities in CHD. Over a 10-year period, the largest relative reductions in population levels of CHD (20.0% in men; 23.9% in women) would be achieved if all social groups met the HP2010 targets. CHD disparities would be most reduced if the less educated (absolute disparities reduced by 66.1% in men; 56.3% in women) and the low income group (absolute disparities reduced by 93.7% in men; 94.3% in women) achieved the targets before the most advantaged. These reductions are larger than those expected if targets were achieved overall for the population but relative social group differences in risk factors remained, or under leveling-up approaches in which the least advantaged achieved the current levels of risk factors of the most advantaged.

This study presents data on the prevalence of low fruit and vegetable intake for 52 countries and for various sociodemographic groups and settings across these countries. METHODS: Data from 196,373 adult participants from 52 countries taking part in the World Health Survey (2002-2003) were analyzed in the summer of 2008. Low fruit and vegetable consumption was defined according to the WHO guidelines of a minimum of five servings of fruits and/or vegetables daily. RESULTS: Low fruit and vegetable consumption prevalence ranged from 36.6% (Ghana) to 99.2% (Pakistan) for men and from 38.0% (Ghana) to 99.3% (Pakistan) for women. Significant differences in the likelihood of low fruit and vegetable intake between men and women were found in 15 countries. The prevalence of low fruit and vegetable consumption tended to increase with age and decrease with income. Although urbanicity was not associated overall with low fruit and vegetable consumption, urban and rural differences were significant for 11 countries. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 77.6% of men and 78.4% of women from the 52 mainly low- and middle-income countries consumed less than the minimum recommended five daily servings of fruits and vegetables.

Most prior investigations have looked at relative abilities to explain such inequalities. In addition, little research focuses on Asian countries, despite the fact that the prevalence and socioeconomic distribution of risk factors for mortality are different there. This study examined relative and absolute abilities of material, psychosocial, and behavioral pathways to explain educational and occupational inequalities in mortality in a nationally representative sample from South Korea. The 1998 and 2001 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data were pooled and linked to national mortality data. Of 8366 men and women over 30 years of age, 310 died between 1999 and 2005. Nine pathway variables were examined: three material factors (income, health insurance, and car ownership status), three psychosocial factors (depression, stress, and marital status), and three behavioral factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical exercise). The relative risk and relative index of inequality were used as measures of relative inequality, and risk differences and the slope index of inequality were used as measures of absolute inequality. Material factors explained a total of 29.0% of the excess in relative risk for education and 50.0% of the excess in relative risk for occupational class. Material factors explained 78.6% of the excess in absolute mortality difference for education and 41.1% for occupational class. Psychosocial factors for both education and occupational class had a relative and absolute explanatory power of less than 15%. Behavioral factors showed a relative explanatory power of about 15%, but absolute explanatory power reached 84.0% for education and 105.4% for occupational class. However, the number of deaths used to calculate the absolute explanatory power was small. Results of this study suggest that absolute socioeconomic mortality inequalities could be substantially reduced if behavioral risk factors were reduced in the whole population.","tags":[],"title":"The contribution of material, psychosocial, and behavioral factors in explaining educational and occupational mortality inequalities in a nationally representative sample of South Koreans: relative and absolute perspectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper","John Lynch","Stephen C Meersman","Nancy Breen","William W Davis","Marsha C Reichman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039221,"objectID":"df51697737b62f226c112e3a8695f1b7","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2009-ab/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:07:01.729765Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2009-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States and varies systematically by race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

They apply four measures of relative disparity and three measures of absolute disparity to trends in US lung cancer incidence by area-socioeconomic position and race-ethnicity from 1992 to 2004. Among females, measures of absolute and relative disparity suggested that area-socioeconomic and race-ethnic disparities increased over these 12 years but differed widely with respect to the magnitude of the change. Among males, the authors found substantial disagreement among summary measures of relative disparity with respect to the magnitude and the direction of change in disparities. Among area-socioeconomic groups, the index of disparity increased by 47% and the relative concentration index decreased by 116%, while for race-ethnicity the index of disparity increased by 36% and the Theil index increased by 13%. The choice of a summary measure of disparity may affect the interpretation of changes in health disparities. Important issues to consider are the reference point from which differences are measured, whether to measure disparity on the absolute or relative scale, and whether to weight disparity measures by population size.

METHODS: The authors calculated the Relative Concentration Index of educational inequality for five health behaviors on adults from all 50 states and the District of Columbia using data from 1990 to 2004 in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n=2,118,562). Linear regression was used to measure changes and trends in the Relative Concentration Index of health inequality across education groups in each state. RESULTS: Except for binge alcohol use, poorer health behaviors were concentrated among the less educated. The largest educational inequalities were for physical inactivity. From 1990 to 2004, significant increases in relative educational inequalities occurred in 40 states for smoking and 31 states for physical inactivity. For binge alcohol use, 27 states showed significant declining inequality trends, but educational inequalities reversed direction and binge alcohol use is now more prevalent among the less educated in 19 states. Significant decreases in educational inequalities occurred in 36 states for obesity and 24 states for seat belt use. Changes in educational inequalities across the different health behaviors were not associated, except for a modest correlation between changes in inequality in smoking and binge alcohol use (r=0.40; p=0.004). Similarly, there was little association between changes in the population prevalence of health behaviors and changes in educational inequality in health behaviors, with substantial heterogeneity among states.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of specific age groups and causes of death contributing to the changes in the black-white life expectancy gap from 1983-2003. DESIGN AND SETTING: US vital statistics data from the US National Vital Statistics System, maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics. Standard life table techniques were used to decompose the change in the black-white life expectancy gap by combining absolute changes in age-specific mortality with relative changes in the distribution of causes of death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The gap in life expectancy at birth between blacks and whites. RESULTS: Among females, the black-white life expectancy gap increased 0.5 years in the period 1983-1993, primarily due to increased mortality from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (0.4 years) and slower declines in heart disease (0.1 years), which were somewhat offset by relative improvements in stroke (-0.1 years). The gap among males increased by 2 years in the period 1983-1993, principally because of adverse changes in HIV (1.1 years), homicide (0.5 years), and heart disease (0.3 years). Between 1993 and 2003, the female gap decreased by 1 year (from 5.59 to 4.54 years). Half of the total narrowing of the gap among females was due to relative mortality improvement among blacks in heart disease (-0.2 years), homicide (-0.2 years), and unintentional injuries (-0.1 years). The decline in the life expectancy gap was larger among males, declining by 25% (from 8.44 to 6.33 years). Nearly all of the 2.1-year decline among males was due to relative mortality improvement among blacks at ages 15 to 49 years (-2.0 years). Three causes of death accounted for 71% of the narrowing of the gap among males (homicide [-0.6 years], HIV [-0.6 years], and unintentional injuries [-0.3 years]), and lack of improvement in heart disease at older ages kept the gap from narrowing further. CONCLUSIONS: After widening during the late 1980s, the black-white life expectancy gap has declined because of relative mortality improvements in homicide, HIV, unintentional injuries, and, among females, heart disease. Further narrowing of the gap will require concerted efforts in public health and health care to address the major causes of the remaining gap from cardiovascular diseases, homicide, HIV, and infant mortality.","tags":[],"title":"Trends in the black-white life expectancy gap in the United States, 1983-2003","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1170288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039218,"objectID":"c45cbf74c40660dc3395af87d98c1b4b","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2007-ae/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:06:58.495772Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2007-ae/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Did clean water reduce black-white mortality inequalities in the United States?

This study examines possible socioeconomic mortality differentials in Korean adolescents. Method A total of 330 321 boys and 311 830 girls aged 10-19, who are health insurance beneficiaries for civil servants and private school teachers of Korean Health Insurance Cooperation, were followed for 9 years (1995-2003). Parental income information was linked to national death certificate data. RESULTS: For boys, all-cause mortality showed a graded inverse relationship with income level in both 10-14 year olds (RR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91) and 15-19 year olds (RR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.40-1.91). The major contributor was mortality differentials from external causes, with differentials of transport accident death the most important. Mortality from circulatory disease was higher in the lowest income groups in 15-19 year olds (RR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50). A significant socioeconomic gradient of non-external cause mortality was found in 15-19 year olds. For girls, socioeconomic differentials were less evident than boys. The all-cause mortality gradient for girls was smaller than for boys and only significant between the lowest and the highest tertile in both 10-14 year olds and 15-19 year olds (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.72, RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11-1.72, respectively). There were significant socioeconomic mortality differentials in all external causes and transport accidents and a marginally significant difference in suicide mortality for 10-19 year olds. Mortality from non-external causes showed no social gradient in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic differentials in all-cause mortality were observed in adolescents, even in early youth. This pattern might also apply to mortality from non-external causes, especially cardiovascular disease in 15-19 year old males.","tags":[],"title":"Socioeconomic differentials in cause-specific mortality among South Korean adolescents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1149120000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039218,"objectID":"5177730b0ca9c3bb52c2275c04af3c9c","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/harper-2006-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:06:58.126924Z","relpermalink":"/publication/harper-2006-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Commentary: what explains widening geographic differences in life expectancy in New Zealand?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Lynch","George Davey Smith","Sam Harper","Kathleen Bainbridge"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1146441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039218,"objectID":"f4ff361d456c02a06b76390bc6028077","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/lynch-2006-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:06:57.826118Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lynch-2006-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: There are contradictory perspectives on the importance of conventional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in explaining population levels and social gradients in CHD. This study examined the contribution of conventional CHD risk factors (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes) to explaining population levels and to absolute and relative social inequalities in CHD. This was investigated in an entire population and by creating a low risk sub-population with no smoking, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, and hypertension to simulate what would happen to relative and social inequalities in CHD if conventional risk factors were removed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population based study of 2682 eastern Finnish men aged 42, 48, 54, 60 at baseline with 10.5 years average follow up of fatal (ICD9 codes 410-414) and non-fatal (MONICA criteria) CHD events. MAIN RESULTS: In the whole population, 94.6% of events occurred among men exposed to at least one conventional risk factor, with a PAR of 68%. Adjustment for conventional risk factors reduced relative social inequality by 24%. However, in a low risk population free from conventional risk factors, absolute social inequality reduced by 72%. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional risk factors explain the majority of absolute social inequality in CHD because conventional risk factors explain the vast majority of CHD cases in the population. However, the role of conventional risk factors in explaining relative social inequality was modest. This apparent paradox may arise in populations where inequalities in conventional risk factors between social groups are low, relative to the high levels of conventional risk factors within every social group. If the concern is to reduce the overall population health burden of CHD and the disproportionate population health burden associated with the social inequalities in CHD, then reducing conventional risk factors will do the job.","tags":[],"title":"Explaining the social gradient in coronary heart disease: comparing relative and absolute risk approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rod Jackson","John Lynch","Sam Harper"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1141171200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039217,"objectID":"e854df889899bbd37f1b27d5e88159c8","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/jackson-2006-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:06:57.621496Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jackson-2006-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Preventing coronary heart disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John Lynch","Sam Harper","George A Kaplan","George Davey Smith"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1122854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039217,"objectID":"c8384f1c33145fbc2e9f26fd60b0e990","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/lynch-2005-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:06:57.408467Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lynch-2005-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: We used census data to examine associations between income inequality and mortality among US states for each decade from 1949 to 1999 and tax return income data to estimate associations for 1989.

RESULTS: Census income analyses revealed little association between income inequality and mortality for 1949, 1959, or 1969. An association emerged for 1979 and strengthened for 1989 but weakened for 1999. When income inequality was based on tax return data, associations were weaker for both 1989 and 1999.

In addition, when tax return rather than census data were used, the association was weaker for 1989 and 1999.

In this analysis, we examined the relationship between income inequality and preterm birth (PTB) and post-neonatal mortality (PNM) to explore two potential mechanisms-the proposed psychosocial stress and neo-material pathways. METHODS: Data on singleton births from 1998 to 2000 were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics' Linked Birth and Infant Death files. The Gini Index was utilized to measure income inequality and was divided into tertiles representing high, medium, and low county-level inequality. To determine the association between the birth outcomes and county income inequality and to account for clustering within counties, we employed generalized estimating equation (GEE) modelling. RESULTS: PTB increased from 8.3% in counties with low income inequality to 10.0% in counties with high inequality. The Gini Index remained modestly associated with PTB after adjusting for individual level variables and mean county-level per capita income within the total population (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) as well as within most of the racial/ethnic groups. PNM increased from 1.15 deaths per 1000 live births in low inequality counties to 1.32 in high-inequality counties. However, after adjustment, income inequality was only associated with PNM within the non-Hispanic black population (AOR: 1.20; 95% CI 1.03-1.39). CONCLUSIONS: These findings may provide some support for the association between income inequality and PTB. Further research is required to elucidate the biological mechanisms of income inequality.","tags":[],"title":"Contextual effect of income inequality on birth outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C Cecily Kelleher","John Lynch","Sam Harper","Joseph B Tay","Geraldine Nolan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1101859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601039217,"objectID":"223b22364a795f26dfaa7dd0e3d7e022","permalink":"http://sbh4th.github.io/publication/kelleher-2004-aa/","publishdate":"2020-09-25T13:06:56.813498Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kelleher-2004-aa/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES: We performed a historical review of cardiovascular risk profiles of Irish immigrants to the United States, 1850-1970, in regard to lifestyle, socio-economic circumstances, and social capital.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe the development of community contextual health profiles, present the rationale supporting each of the profile dimensions, and provide examples of relevant data sources.

We evaluated the effect of socioeconomic conditions over the life course on measures of psychosocial functioning in adulthood. METHODS: Life course socioeconomic position was assessed by retrospective recall of parents' education and occupation when the respondent was age 10, and the respondents' education, occupation, and income in 2585 men from eastern Finland aged 42, 48, 54, and 60 years. Measures of psychosocial functioning were derived from scales measuring cynical hostility, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Men with both parents who had less than a primary school education or who both had unskilled manual jobs had higher age-adjusted levels of cynical hostility, hopelessness, and depressive symptoms in adulthood. Mutually adjusted analyses showed that parents' education and the respondents' education, occupation, and income all had statistically independent effects on adult levels of cynical hostility and hopelessness. For instance, men for whom neither parent had completed primary education had a 0.15 standard deviation (P = 0.006) higher cynical hostility score, and a 0.20 standard deviation (P = 0.00018) higher hopelessness score, after adjustment for education, occupation and income. In contrast, depressive symptoms in adulthood were only associated with the respondent's occupation and income. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood socioeconomic position was associated with adult psychosocial functioning, but these effects were specific to some aspects of adult psychosocial functioning--cynical hostility and hopelessness, but not depressive symptoms. Adult occupation and income were associated with all measures of psychosocial functioning. In addition to the impact of adult socioeconomic position, some aspects of poor psychosocial functioning in adulthood may also have socioeconomic roots early in life.","tags":[],"title":"Life course socioeconomic conditions and adult psychosocial functioning","type":"publication"}]
