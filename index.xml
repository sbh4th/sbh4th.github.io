&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is a leading public health problem. Over 400 million Chinese homes burn coal to meet their indoor space heating needs, leading to high levels of air pollution and health impacts in adults and children. Coal burning in China also contributes to poor air quality and mercury contamination in Canada. This project will assess how transitioning away from coal and introducing new clean heating technology in China will impact the health and environment of people who live in homes impacted by policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/arijit-nandi&#34;&gt;Arijit Nandi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ihi.or.tz/&#34;&gt;Ifakara Health Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://care.ca/tamani&#34;&gt;CARE Canada&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are monitoring and evaluating a health systems strengthening program being implemented by CARE Canada, in partnership with the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) and the Canadian Society for International Health (CSIH), in the Tabora region of Tanzania. The aim of this program is to reduce maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity by improving the availability of quality maternal and newborn healthcare services. Activities include: training and mentoring of Regional and District Council Health Management Teams (R/CHMTs) in data management and usage, supply chain management, budgeting and leadership; development of an emergency transportation system; refurbishing health centre and hospital maternity wards and procuring Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn CARE (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn CARE (CEmONC) equipment; training and mentoring of health care workers (HCWs) on BEmONC, CEmONC and family planning; and training and support of Community Health Workers (CHWs) to deliver quality maternal and newborn health education and promote utilization of health care services. We will be assessing the program’s impacts by integrating monitoring and evaluation with the delivery of interventions using a randomized phase-in or “stepped wedge” design.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Affordable Daycare To Empower Indian Women</title>

&lt;p&gt;(with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/arijit-nandi&#34;&gt;Arijit Nandi&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are structural barriers to women’s empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable day-care services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable day-care services is a potentially important policy lever for empowering Indian women. Access to day-care might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of day-care programs in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based day-care program on empowerment, economic opportunity, and health among mothers living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the day-care system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video below provides some additional details about the project and some essential context for where this work is being done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is 420 Deadly?</title>
      <link>/post/is-420-deadly/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Friday is April 20th, a day that for most people means nothing. Americans are relieved at having filed their taxes, Canadians are stressed in anticipation of filing theirs, and in Montreal we are still wondering if winter will ever end. However, for a small minority of people, April 20th (or &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;) is a day of celebration of all things cannabis, with large outdoor gatherings where cannabis consumption is promoted, especially at 4:20pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big deal, right? Let ‘em have fun. However, a few weeks ago a short paper was published in a leading medical journal, JAMA Internal Medicine, suggesting that, over the 25 years from 1992-2016, excess cannabis consumption after 4:20pm on &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; increased fatal traffic crashes by 12% relative to fatal crashes that occurred one week before and one week after. Here is the key result from the paper:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;, we hope everyone celebrating does so with enthusiasm, but appropriate caution. Don’t overdo it, take public transit or walk. And if you are thinking of driving, promise that you’ll listen to the entirety of the Dead’s Dark Star &amp;gt; Other One &amp;gt; Lovelight from 1970’s Fillmore East show before getting behind the wheel. Have a safe trip!&lt;/p&gt;
