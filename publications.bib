  abstract = {Background Three genera of human papillomavirus (HPV) infect the oral cavity and oropharynx--- alpha ({$\alpha$}), beta ({$\beta$}) and gamma ({$\gamma$}). While {$\alpha$}-HPV infection is an established risk factor for head and neck cancers (HNC), the role of other genera remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}-, {$\gamma$}-HPV on HNC using a hospital-based case-control study. Methods We recruited incident HNC cases (396) and controls (439), frequency-matched by age and sex from four main referral hospitals in Montreal, Canada. We collected information on sociodemographic and behavior characteristics using in-person interviews, and tested rinse, brush and tumor specimens for HPV genotypes. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of HPV on HNC using logistic regression, adjusting for confounding. We conducted probabilistic bias analysis to account for potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, and residual confounding. Results {$\alpha$}-HPV genus had a strong effect on HNC, particularly HPV16 (aOR=22.6; 95\% CI: 10.8, 47.2). {$\beta$}-HPV was more common among controls (aOR=0.80; 95\% 0.57, 1.11). After adjustment for HPV16, we found weaker evidence for {$\gamma$}-HPV (aOR= 1.29; 95\% CI: 0.80, 2.08). Combined bias analyses for HPV16 increased the strength of the point estimate, but added imprecision (aOR=54.2, 95\%~CI: 10.7, 385.9). Conclusions {$\alpha$}-HPV, especially HPV16, appears to increase the risk for HNC, while there is little evidence for an effect of {$\beta$}- or {$\gamma$}-HPV. {$\beta$}-HPV may have a preventive effect, while {$\gamma$}-HPV may increase the risk of HNC, although to a lesser extent than that of {$\alpha$}-HPV. Results for cutaneous HPV were imprecise and less conclusive. Due to possible epidemiologic biases, the true relation between HPV and HNC could be underestimated in the literature. Further improvement in current methods and more studies of the biologic mechanisms of the three genera in HNC development are warranted.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is an established risk factor for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). Recent reports have shown that genotypes from the beta ({$\beta$}) and gamma ({$\gamma$}) genera, also known as cutaneous HPV, can be found in the oral cavity, but their role is largely unidentified. We investigated the interaction between oral HPV16 and cutaneous HPV in HNC. Methods: We use data on incident HNC cases (n = 384) and frequency-matched hospital-based controls (n = 423) from the HeNCe Life study in Montreal, Canada. Participants were tested for alpha HPV and cutaneous genera using oral mouth rinse and brush samples. We used unconditional logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) as a measure of the effect between HPV and HNC and assessed the interaction between HPV genotypes on the multiplicative and additive scales. Results: Prevalence of HPV infection was higher among cases (73\%) than controls (63.4\%), with cases more likely to be coinfected with more than a single genotype, 52.9\% vs. 43.5\%, respectively. Infection with HPV16 alone had a strong effect on HNC risk aOR = 18.2 [6.2, 53.2], while infection with any cutaneous HPV, but not HPV16, appeared to have the opposite effect aOR = 0.8 [0.6, 1.1]. The observed effect of joint exposure to HPV16 and any cutaneous HPV (aOR = 20.4 [8.3, 50.1]) was stronger than the expected effect based on an assumption of independent exposures but was measured with considerable imprecision. While the point estimate suggests a positive interaction between HPV16 and cutaneous HPV, results were imprecise with relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) = 2.4 [-23.3, 28.2]. Conclusion: There could be biologic interaction between HPV16 and genotypes from cutaneous genera, which warrants further investigation. Although cutaneous HPVs are not usually found in tumor tissues, they are cofactors that could interact with HPV16 in the oral cavity and thus strengthen the latter's carcinogenic effect.},

  abstract = {Background Beyond the prevention of illness and death, vaccination may provide additional benefits such as improved educational outcomes. However, there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among primary school children in India. Methods We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey. Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at least 12 months old at baseline in 2004--2005. In 2011--2012, the same children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included 33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as well as state fixed effects. Results Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54\% were fully vaccinated at baseline, and 54\% could read by the age of 8--11 years. The estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4 to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6\% to 12\%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the treatment and outcome. Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting effects on children's learning achievements. Further work is needed to confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to educational outcomes.},

We sought to determine whether educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Qu{\'e}bec, Canada. Methods The authors analysed 2 124 909 singleton live births from 1981 to 2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of Inequality (SII) with 95\% CIs for the relationship between maternal education and extreme, very or moderate PTB ({$\leq$}27, 28--31, and 32--36 completed weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981--1985, 1986--1990, 1991--1995, 1996--2000, 2001--2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex. Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme PTB increased from 1.58 (95\% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981--1985 to 3.11 (95\% CI 2.54 to 3.81) in 2001--2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were 1.53 (95\% CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95\% CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11\% vs 0.28\%) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67\% vs 3.11\%). Absolute differences in the proportion very PTB did not increase. Conclusions Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and moderate PTB have increased over time in Qu{\'e}bec. Relative increases were largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate PTB.},

Study design: National registry-based quasi-experimental study. Methods: We obtained data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (2010-2020) which was linked to multiple population registries containing sociodemographic variables. A difference-in-discontinuity approach was used to examine the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on various perinatal outcomes. We investigated preterm birth incidence across onset types, alongside other perinatal outcomes including low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age, NICU admission, low-APGAR-score, perinatal mortality, neonatal death, and stillbirths. Results: The analysis of the national-level dataset revealed a consistent pattern of reduced preterm births after the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020 (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI 0.68-0.96). A drop in spontaneous preterm births post-implementation was observed (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI 0.62-0.98), whereas no change was observed for iatrogenic births. Regarding stillbirths (OR = 0.95, 95\% CI 0.46-1.95) our analysis did not find compelling evidence of substantial changes. For the remaining outcomes, no discernible shifts were observed. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the reduction in preterm births following COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands. No discernible changes were observed for other outcomes, including stillbirths. Our results challenge previous concerns of a potential increase in stillbirths contributing to the drop in preterm births, suggesting alternative mechanisms.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveParaguay's health care system is characterized by segmented provision and low public spending, with limited coverage and asymmetries in terms of access and quality of care. The present study provides national estimates of income-related inequality in health care utilization and trends in the country over the past two decades.MethodsUsing data from the Paraguayan Permanent Household Survey, we estimated socioeconomic inequality in health care use during the period 1999--2018. We used poverty-to-income ratio as the socioeconomic stratifier and defined health care use as having reported a health problem and subsequent health care use in the last 90 days before interview. Inequality was summarized by rank- and level-based versions of the Concentration Index for binary outcomes.ResultsInequalities affecting those with lower incomes were present in all years assessed, although the magnitude of these inequalities declined over time. Inequality as expressed by the rank-based index decreased from 0.209 (95\%CI 0.164; 0.253) in 1999 to 0.032 (95\%CI -0.010; 0.075) in 2018. The level-based index decreased from 0.076 (95\%CI -0.029; 0.182) in 1999 to 0.024 (0.002; 0.045) in 2018. Trends in both indices were generally stable from 1999 to 2009, with a noticeable decrease in 2010. The sharpest decreases relative to the 1999 baseline were observed in the period 2010--2018, reflecting changes in health care use and income distribution. Stratification by area, sex and older people suggest similar trends within subgroups.ConclusionsDecreases in inequality coincide temporally with increments in public health expenditure, removal of user fees in public health care facilities and the expansion of conditional cash-transfer programmes. Future research should disentangle the role of each of these policies in explaining the trends described.},

The RCI indicated greater concentration of dengue cases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIs for chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during their introduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellin indicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI decomposition showed that year of notification and age were the main contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5\%, 72.2\% and 54.5\% of the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively.Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age, presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants of the heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomic spectrum.}

The aim of this study was to explore comprehensively the role of individual-level SEP in the associations between specific types of mental disorders and mortality (due to all causes, and to natural or external causes), presenting both relative and absolute measures. This was a cohort study including all residents in Denmark on January 1, 2000, following them up until December 31, 2020. Information on mental disorders, SEP (income percentile, categorized into low, {$<$}20\%; medium, 20-79\%; and high, {$\geq$}80\%), and mortality was obtained from nationwide registers. We computed the average reduction in life expectancy for those with mental disorders, relative and absolute differences in mortality rates, and proportional attributable fractions. Subgroup analyses by sex and age groups were performed. Overall, 5,316,626 individuals (2,689,749 females and 2,626,877 males) were followed up for 95.2 million person-years. People with mental disorders had a shorter average life expectancy than the general population regardless of SEP (70.9-77.0 vs. 77.2-85.1 years, depending on income percentile). Among individuals with a mental disorder, the subgroup in the top 3\% of the income distribution had the longest average life expectancy (77.0 years), and this estimate was lower than the shortest life expectancy in the general Danish population (77.2 years for individuals in the bottom 6\% income distribution). The mortality rate differences were larger in the low-income than the high-income group (19.6 vs. 13.3 per 1,000 person-years). For natural causes of death, a socioeconomic gradient for differences in life expectancy and mortality rates was observed across most diagnoses, both sexes, and all age groups. For external causes, no such gradient was observed. In the low-SEP group, 10.1\% of all deaths and 23.7\% of those related to external causes were attributable to mental disorders, compared with 3.5\% and 8.7\% in the high-SEP group. Thus, our data indicate that people with mental disorders have a shorter life expectancy even than people with the lowest SEP in the general population. The socioeconomic gradients in mortality rates due to natural causes highlight a greater need for coordinated care of physical diseases in people with mental disorders and low SEP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For policy questions where substantial empirical background information exists, conventional frequentist policy analysis is hard to justify. Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but is not often used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016 data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles traveled (95\% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95\% posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95\% posterior interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95\% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods can provide credible estimates of future policy impacts, especially for policy questions that occur in dynamic environments, such as traffic safety.},

The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.},

  abstract = {Background The Tabora Maternal and Newborn Health Initiative project was a multicomponent intervention to improve maternal and newborn health in the Tabora region of Tanzania. Components included training healthcare providers and community health workers, infrastructure upgrades, and improvements to health management. This study aimed to examine the impact of trainings on four key outcomes: skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, respectful maternity care and patient--provider communication. Methods Trainings were delivered sequentially at four time points between 2018 and 2019 in eight districts (two districts at a time). Cross-sectional surveys were administered to a random sample of households in all districts at baseline and after each training wave. Due to practical necessities, the original stepped wedge cluster randomised design of the evaluation was altered mid-programme. Therefore, a difference-in-differences for multiple groups in multiple periods was adopted to compare outcomes in treated districts to not yet treated districts. Risk differences were estimated for the overall average treatment effect on the treated and group/time dynamic effects. Results Respondents reported 3895 deliveries over the course of the study. The intervention was associated with a 12.9 percentage point increase in skilled birth attendance (95\% CI 0.4 to 25.4), which began to increase 4 months after the end of training in each district. There was little evidence of impact on antenatal care visits, respectful treatment during delivery and patient--provider communication. Conclusion Interventions to train local healthcare workers in basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care increased skilled birth attendance but had limited impact on other pregnancy-related outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Antenatal corticosteroids reduce respiratory morbidity in preterm infants, but their use during late preterm gestation (34--36 weeks) is limited because their safety for longer-term child neurodevelopment is unclear. We sought to determine if fetuses with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids had increased rates of prescriptions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication in childhood, using a quasiexperimental design that better controls for confounding than existing observational studies. Methods: We identified 16 358 children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery between 31 + 0 (31 weeks, 0 days) and 36 + 6 weeks' gestation in 2000--2013, using a perinatal data registry from British Columbia, Canada, and linked their records with population-based child ADHD medication data (2000--2018). We used a regression discontinuity design to capitalize on the fact that pregnancies presenting for delivery immediately before and immediately after the clinical cut-off for antenatal corticosteroid administration of 34 + 0 weeks' gestation have very different levels of exposure to corticosteroids, but are otherwise similar with respect to confounders. Results: Over a median follow-up period of 9 years, 892 (5.5\%) children had 1 or more dispensations of ADHD medication. Children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery just before the corticosteroid clinical cut-off of 34 + 0 weeks' gestation did not appear to be more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication than those admitted just after the cut-off (rate ratio 1.1, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 1.6; 1.3 excess cases per 100 children, 95\% CI -2.5 to 5.7). Interpretation: We found little evidence that children with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids have higher rates of ADHD prescriptions in childhood, supporting the safety of antenatal corticosteroids for this neurodevelopmental outcome.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in China is thought to have reduced air pollution emissions due to reduced human mobility and economic activities. Few studies have assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on community and indoor air quality in environments with diverse socioeconomic and household energy use patterns. The main goal of this study was to evaluate whether indoor and community air pollution differed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in homes with different energy use patterns. Using calibrated real-time PM2.5 sensors, we measured indoor and community air quality in 147 homes from 30 villages in Beijing over 4 months including periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Community pollution was higher during the lockdown (61 {\textpm} 47 {$\mu$}g/m3) compared with before (45 {\textpm} 35 {$\mu$}g/m3, p {$<$} 0.001) and after (47 {\textpm} 37 {$\mu$}g/m3, p {$<$} 0.001) the lockdown. However, we did not observe significantly increased indoor PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Indoor-generated PM2.5 in homes using clean energy for heating without smokers was the lowest compared with those using solid fuel with/without smokers, implying air pollutant emissions are reduced in homes using clean energy. Indoor air quality may not have been impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown in rural settings in China and appeared to be more impacted by the household energy choice and indoor smoking than the COVID-19 lockdown. As clean energy transitions occurred in rural households in northern China, our work highlights the importance of understanding multiple possible indoor sources to interpret the impacts of interventions, intended or otherwise.},

  abstract = {The Chinese government implemented a national household energy transition program that replaced residential coal heating stoves with electricity-powered heat pumps for space heating in northern China. As part of a baseline assessment of the program, this study investigated variability in personal air pollution exposures within villages and between villages and evaluated exposure patterns by sociodemographic factors. We randomly recruited 446 participants in 50 villages in four districts in rural Beijing and measured 24 h personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). The geometric mean personal exposure to PM2.5 and BC was 72 and 2.5 {$\mu$}g/m3, respectively. The variability in PM2.5 and BC exposures was greater within villages than between villages. Study participants who used traditional stoves as their dominant source of space heating were exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5 and BC. Wealthier households tended to burn more coal for space heating, whereas less wealthy households used more biomass. PM2.5 and BC exposures were almost uniformly distributed by socioeconomic status. Future work that combines these results with PM2.5 chemical composition analysis will shed light on whether air pollution source contributors (e.g., industrial, traffic, and household solid fuel burning) follow similar distributions.},

The strongest evidence for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even that is somewhat mixed.

  abstract = {Background Starting in 2006 to 2007, the Government of Bangladesh implemented the Maternal Health Voucher Scheme (MHVS). This program provides pregnant women with vouchers that can be exchanged for health services from eligible public and private sector providers. In this study, we examined whether access to the MHVS was associated with maternal health services utilization, stillbirth, and neonatal and infant mortality. Methods and findings We used information on pregnancies and live births between 2000 to 2016 reported by women 15 to 49 years of age surveyed as part of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys. Our analytic sample included 23,275 pregnancies lasting at least 7 months for analyses of stillbirth and between 15,125 and 21,668 live births for analyses of health services use, neonatal, and infant mortality. With respect to live births occurring prior to the introduction of the MHVS, 31.3\%, 14.1\%, and 18.0\% of women, respectively, reported receiving at least 3 antenatal care visits, delivering in a health institution, and having a skilled birth attendant at delivery. Rates of neonatal and infant mortality during this period were 40 and 63 per 1,000 live births, respectively, and there were 32 stillbirths per 1,000 pregnancies lasting at least 7 months. We applied a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of providing subdistrict-level access to the MHVS program, with inverse probability of treatment weights to address selection into the program. The introduction of the MHVS program was associated with a lagged improvement in the probability of delivering in a health facility, one of the primary targets of the program, although associations with other health services were less evident. After 6 years of access to the MHVS, the probabilities of reporting at least 3 antenatal care visits, delivering in a health facility, and having a skilled birth attendant present increased by 3.0 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = -4.8, 10.7], 6.5 (95\% CI = -0.6, 13.6), and 5.8 (95\% CI = -1.8, 13.3) percentage points, respectively. We did not observe evidence consistent with the program improving health outcomes, with probabilities of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and infant mortality decreasing by 0.7 (95\% CI = -1.3, 2.6), 0.8 (95\% CI = -1.7, 3.4), and 1.3 (95\% CI = -2.5, 5.1) percentage points, respectively, after 6 years of access to the MHVS. The sample size was insufficient to detect smaller associations with adequate precision. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of measurement error, although it was likely nondifferential by treatment group, or unmeasured confounding by concomitant interventions that were implemented differentially in treated and control areas. Conclusions In this study, we found that the introduction of the MHVS was positively associated with the probability of delivering in a health facility, but despite a longer period of follow-up than most extant evaluations, we did not observe attendant reductions in stillbirth, neonatal mortality, or infant mortality. Further work and engagement with stakeholders is needed to assess if the MHVS has affected the quality of care and health inequalities and whether the design and eligibility of the program should be modified to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Women in India are often responsible for unpaid household work, family caregiving, and paid work, which can contribute to poorer mental health. The provision of childcare has the potential to improve women's mental health, but evidence on the effects of providing access to daycare is limited. Methods We designed a cluster-randomised trial and used data from a sample of 2858 mothers with age-eligible children from 160 village hamlets in rural Rajasthan, India, to evaluate the impact of providing access to a community-based daycare programme on social and emotional aspects of women's mental health. We conducted a baseline survey in early 2016, randomised hamlets to intervention or control groups approximately six months later, and delivered the final post-intervention survey approximately two years thereafter. Results Treatment assignment increased the probability that a respondent used a daycare over the two-year follow-up by 40.9 percentage points. Providing randomised access to a daycare resulted in 0.2 (95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,-0.1, 0.4) fewer symptoms of mental distress, representing a 9.5\% decline compared to the baseline mean of 2.1 symptoms, as well as a 3.7 (95\% CI\,=\,-0.8, 8.3) percentage point increase in the proportion of women who reported feeling very happy, equivalent to an 11.0\% increase relative to the baseline mean of 33.6\%. Among social indicators, treatment assignment was associated with a 5.6 (95\% CI\,=\,-1.2, 12.4) percentage point increase in membership in an association, a relative increase of 43.4\% compared to the baseline mean of 12.9\%. The intervention did not have an appreciable impact on measures of life satisfaction or trust in institutions. Two-stage least squares instrumental variable analyses showed that daycare use decreased mental distress by 0.4 (95\% CI\,=\,-0.1, 0.8) symptoms, increased the proportion of women who were very happy by 9.4 (95\% CI\,=\,0.0, 17.6) percentage points, and increased membership in an organisation by 15.9 (95\% CI\,=\,8.4, 23.7) percentage points. Conclusions The provision of affordable, community-based daycare was associated with substantial uptake and showed potential for improving mothers' mental health in a rural context where most women were not employed in the formal labour force.

  abstract = {Treatment effects can be measured on the relative scale (eg, risk ratios, odds ratios) or the absolute scale (eg, risk differences). If the baseline risk of an outcome is different between subgroups, the effect of the treatment will differ between subgroups on at least one scale (relative, absolute, or both). We illustrate this using two examples from the literature where only relative effects were estimated, but conclusions about subgroup differences would likely have changed had absolute effects also been considered. To identify all meaningful subgroup differences, researchers and clinicians should compare~effects on the relative and absolute scale.},

  abstract = {Objectives:~           We aimed to estimate the effects of indoor and outdoor temperature on wintertime blood pressure (BP) among peri-urban Beijing adults.           Methods:~           We enrolled 1279 adults (ages: 40--89 years) and conducted measurements in two winter campaigns in 2018--2019 and 2019--2020. Study staff traveled to participant homes to administer a questionnaire and measure brachial and central BP. Indoor temperature was measured in the 5 min prior to BP measurement. Outdoor temperature was estimated from regional meteorological stations. We used multivariable mixed-effects regression models to estimate the within-individual and between-individual effects of indoor and outdoor temperatures on BP.           Results:~           Indoor and outdoor temperatures ranged from 0.0 to 28 {$^\circ$}C and -14.3 to 6.4 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. In adjusted models, a 1 {$^\circ$}C increase in indoor temperature was associated with decreased SBP [-0.4 mmHg, 95\% confidence interval (CI): -0.7 to -0.1 (between-individual; brachial and central BP); -0.5 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.8 to -0.2 (within-individual, brachial BP); -0.4 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.7 to -0.2 (within-individual, central BP)], DBP [-0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI:-0.4 to -0.03 (between-individual); -0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.5 to -0.04 (within-individual)], and within-individual pulse pressure [-0.2 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.4 to -0.04 (central); -0.3 mmHg, 95\% CI: -0.4 to -0.1 (brachial)]. Between-individual SBP estimates were larger among participants with hypertension. There was no evidence of an effect of outdoor temperature on BP.           Conclusion:~           Our results support previous findings of inverse associations between indoor temperature and BP but contrast with prior evidence of an inverse relationship with outdoor temperature. Wintertime home heating may be a population-wide intervention strategy for high BP and cardiovascular disease in China.},

  abstract = {Introduction There is substantial debate concerning the impact of cannabis decriminalization and legalization on road safety outcomes. Methods Seven databases were systematically searched: Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO through Ovid as well as Web of Science Core Collection, SafetyLit, Criminal Justice Database (ProQuest), and Transport Research International Documentation (from inception to June 16, 2021). Eligible primary studies examined group-level cannabis decriminalization or legalization and a road safety outcome in any population. Results A total of 65 reports of 64 observational studies were eligible, including 39 that applied a quasi-experimental design. Studies examined recreational cannabis legalization (n=50), medical cannabis legalization (n=22), and cannabis decriminalization (n=5). All studies except 1 used data from the U.S. or Canada. Studies found mixed impacts of legalization on attitudes, beliefs, and self-reported driving under the influence. Medical legalization, recreational legalization, and decriminalization were associated with increases in positive cannabis tests among drivers. Few studies examined impacts on alcohol or other drug use, although findings suggested a decrease in positive alcohol tests among drivers associated with medical legalization. Medical legalization was associated with reductions in fatal motor-vehicle collisions, whereas recreational legalization was conversely associated with increases in fatal collisions. Discussion Increased cannabis positivity may reflect changes in cannabis use; however, it does not in itself indicate increased impaired driving. Subgroups impacted by medical and recreational legalization, respectively, likely explain opposing findings for fatal collisions. More research is needed concerning cannabis decriminalization; the impacts of decriminalization and legalization on nonfatal injuries, alcohol and other drugs; and the mechanisms by which legalization impacts road safety outcomes.}
