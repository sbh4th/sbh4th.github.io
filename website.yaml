  abstract: "Background\nThree genera of human papillomavirus (HPV) infect the oral cavity and oropharynx— alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ). While α-HPV infection is an established risk factor for head and neck cancers (HNC), the role of other genera remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of α-, β-, γ-HPV on HNC using a hospital-based case-control study.\nMethods\nWe recruited incident HNC cases (396) and controls (439), frequency-matched by age and sex from four main referral hospitals in Montreal, Canada. We collected information on sociodemographic and behavior characteristics using in-person interviews, and tested rinse, brush and tumor specimens for HPV genotypes. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of HPV on HNC using logistic regression, adjusting for confounding. We conducted probabilistic bias analysis to account for potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, and residual confounding.\nResults\nα-HPV genus had a strong effect on HNC, particularly HPV16 (aOR=22.6; 95% CI: 10.8, 47.2). β-HPV was more common among controls (aOR=0.80; 95% 0.57, 1.11). After adjustment for HPV16, we found weaker evidence for γ-HPV (aOR= 1.29; 95% CI: 0.80, 2.08). Combined bias analyses for HPV16 increased the strength of the point estimate, but added imprecision (aOR=54.2, 95%\_CI: 10.7, 385.9).\nConclusions\nα-HPV, especially HPV16, appears to increase the risk for HNC, while there is little evidence for an effect of β- or γ-HPV. β-HPV may have a preventive effect, while γ-HPV may increase the risk of HNC, although to a lesser extent than that of α-HPV. Results for cutaneous HPV were imprecise and less conclusive. Due to possible epidemiologic biases, the true relation between HPV and HNC could be underestimated in the literature. Further improvement in current methods and more studies of the biologic mechanisms of the three genera in HNC development are warranted."

    Objectives: Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is an established risk factor
    for Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). Recent reports have shown that genotypes
    from the beta (β) and gamma (γ) genera, also known as cutaneous HPV, can be
    found in the oral cavity, but their role is largely unidentified. We
    investigated the interaction between oral HPV16 and cutaneous HPV in HNC.
    Methods: We use data on incident HNC cases (n = 384) and frequency-matched
    hospital-based controls (n = 423) from the HeNCe Life study in Montreal,
    Canada. Participants were tested for alpha HPV and cutaneous genera using
    oral mouth rinse and brush samples. We used unconditional logistic
    regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence interval
    (CI) as a measure of the effect between HPV and HNC and assessed the
    interaction between HPV genotypes on the multiplicative and additive scales.
    Results: Prevalence of HPV infection was higher among cases (73%) than
    controls (63.4%), with cases more likely to be coinfected with more than a
    single genotype, 52.9% vs. 43.5%, respectively. Infection with HPV16 alone
    had a strong effect on HNC risk aOR = 18.2 [6.2, 53.2], while infection with
    any cutaneous HPV, but not HPV16, appeared to have the opposite effect aOR =
    0.8 [0.6, 1.1]. The observed effect of joint exposure to HPV16 and any
    cutaneous HPV (aOR = 20.4 [8.3, 50.1]) was stronger than the expected effect
    based on an assumption of independent exposures but was measured with
    considerable imprecision. While the point estimate suggests a positive
    interaction between HPV16 and cutaneous HPV, results were imprecise with
    relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) = 2.4 [−23.3, 28.2].
    Conclusion: There could be biologic interaction between HPV16 and genotypes
    from cutaneous genera, which warrants further investigation. Although
    cutaneous HPVs are not usually found in tumor tissues, they are cofactors
    that could interact with HPV16 in the oral cavity and thus strengthen the
    latter’s carcinogenic effect.

    Background Beyond the prevention of illness and death, vaccination may
    provide additional benefits such as improved educational outcomes. However,
    there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to
    estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among
    primary school children in India.

    Methods We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey.
    Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at
    least 12 months old at baseline in 2004–2005. In 2011–2012, the same
    children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the
    effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using
    inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and
    results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included
    33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as
    well as state fixed effects.

    Results Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54% were fully
    vaccinated at baseline, and 54% could read by the age of 8–11 years. The
    estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4
    to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6% to
    12%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by
    unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the
    treatment and outcome.

    Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting
    effects on children’s learning achievements. Further work is needed to
    confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to
    educational outcomes.

    Background Few studies have evaluated the relationship between preterm birth
    (PTB) and maternal education over time. We sought to determine whether
    educational inequalities in PTB have increased in Québec, Canada.

    Methods The authors analysed 2 124 909 singleton live births from 1981 to
    2006, and computed the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and Slope Index of
    Inequality (SII) with 95% CIs for the relationship between maternal
    education and extreme, very or moderate PTB (≤27, 28–31, and 32–36 completed
    weeks of gestation, respectively) for five periods (1981–1985, 1986–1990,
    1991–1995, 1996–2000, 2001–2006), adjusting for maternal age, marital
    status, birthplace, language spoken at home, parity and infant sex.

    Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but
    decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over
    time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme
    PTB increased from 1.58 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981–1985 to 3.11 (95% CI
    2.54 to 3.81) in 2001–2006. For moderate PTB, the corresponding RIIs were
    1.53 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.61) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.81 to 2.01). Absolute
    differences in the PTB proportion between the least and most educated
    mothers increased from 1981 to 2006 for extreme (adjusted SII 0.11% vs
    0.28%) and moderate PTB (adjusted SII 1.67% vs 3.11%). Absolute differences
    in the proportion very PTB did not increase.

    Conclusions Relative and absolute educational inequalities in extreme and
    moderate PTB have increased over time in Québec. Relative increases were
    largest for extreme PTB, and absolute increases were largest for moderate
    PTB.

    Background: In cardiovascular research, pre-hospital mortality represents an
    important potential source of selection bias. Inverse probability of
    censoring weights are a method to account for this source of bias. The
    objective of this article is to examine and correct for the inﬂuence of
    selection bias due to pre-hospital mortality on the relationship between
    cardiovascular risk factors and all-cause mortality after an acute cardiac
    event.

    Objective: Investigate the acute impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures
    implemented in March 2020 on a comprehensive range of perinatal outcomes.


    Study design: National registry-based quasi-experimental study.


    Methods: We obtained data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (2010-2020)
    which was linked to multiple population registries containing
    sociodemographic variables. A difference-in-discontinuity approach was used
    to examine the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on various perinatal
    outcomes. We investigated preterm birth incidence across onset types,
    alongside other perinatal outcomes including low birth weight,
    small-for-gestational-age, NICU admission, low-APGAR-score, perinatal
    mortality, neonatal death, and stillbirths.


    Results: The analysis of the national-level dataset revealed a consistent
    pattern of reduced preterm births after the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation
    measures on March 9, 2020 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.96). A drop in
    spontaneous preterm births post-implementation was observed (OR = 0.80, 95%
    CI 0.62-0.98), whereas no change was observed for iatrogenic births.
    Regarding stillbirths (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.46-1.95) our analysis did not
    find compelling evidence of substantial changes. For the remaining outcomes,
    no discernible shifts were observed.


    Conclusions: Our findings confirm the reduction in preterm births following
    COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands. No discernible changes were
    observed for other outcomes, including stillbirths. Our results challenge
    previous concerns of a potential increase in stillbirths contributing to the
    drop in preterm births, suggesting alternative mechanisms.

    ObjectiveParaguay’s health care system is characterized by segmented
    provision and low public spending, with limited coverage and asymmetries in
    terms of access and quality of care. The present study provides national
    estimates of income-related inequality in health care utilization and trends
    in the country over the past two decades.MethodsUsing data from the
    Paraguayan Permanent Household Survey, we estimated socioeconomic inequality
    in health care use during the period 1999–2018. We used poverty-to-income
    ratio as the socioeconomic stratifier and defined health care use as having
    reported a health problem and subsequent health care use in the last 90 days
    before interview. Inequality was summarized by rank- and level-based
    versions of the Concentration Index for binary outcomes.ResultsInequalities
    affecting those with lower incomes were present in all years assessed,
    although the magnitude of these inequalities declined over time. Inequality
    as expressed by the rank-based index decreased from 0.209 (95%CI 0.164;
    0.253) in 1999 to 0.032 (95%CI -0.010; 0.075) in 2018. The level-based index
    decreased from 0.076 (95%CI -0.029; 0.182) in 1999 to 0.024 (0.002; 0.045)
    in 2018. Trends in both indices were generally stable from 1999 to 2009,
    with a noticeable decrease in 2010. The sharpest decreases relative to the
    1999 baseline were observed in the period 2010–2018, reflecting changes in
    health care use and income distribution. Stratification by area, sex and
    older people suggest similar trends within subgroups.ConclusionsDecreases in
    inequality coincide temporally with increments in public health expenditure,
    removal of user fees in public health care facilities and the expansion of
    conditional cash-transfer programmes. Future research should disentangle the
    role of each of these policies in explaining the trends described.

    We used surveillance data from Brazil and Colombia during 2007–2017 to
    assess the presence of socioeconomic inequalities on dengue, chikungunya and
    Zika at the neighborhood level in two Latin American cities.To quantify the
    inequality, we estimated and decomposed the relative concentration index of
    inequality (RCI) accounting for the spatiotemporal distribution of the
    diseases.There were 281 426 arboviral cases notified in Fortaleza, Brazil,
    and 40 889 in Medellin, Colombia. The RCI indicated greater concentration of
    dengue cases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both
    sites. The RCIs for chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality
    during their introduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya
    in Medellin indicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI
    decomposition showed that year of notification and age were the main
    contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed
    that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5%
    of the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika,
    respectively.Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of
    arboviruses and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We
    corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic
    neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age, presence of
    healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants of the
    heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomic
    spectrum.

    Mental disorders are associated with elevated mortality rates and reduced
    life expectancy. However, it is unclear whether these associations differ by
    socioeconomic position (SEP). The aim of this study was to explore
    comprehensively the role of individual-level SEP in the associations between
    specific types of mental disorders and mortality (due to all causes, and to
    natural or external causes), presenting both relative and absolute measures.
    This was a cohort study including all residents in Denmark on January 1,
    2000, following them up until December 31, 2020. Information on mental
    disorders, SEP (income percentile, categorized into low, <20%; medium,
    20-79%; and high, ≥80%), and mortality was obtained from nationwide
    registers. We computed the average reduction in life expectancy for those
    with mental disorders, relative and absolute differences in mortality rates,
    and proportional attributable fractions. Subgroup analyses by sex and age
    groups were performed. Overall, 5,316,626 individuals (2,689,749 females and
    2,626,877 males) were followed up for 95.2 million person-years. People with
    mental disorders had a shorter average life expectancy than the general
    population regardless of SEP (70.9-77.0 vs. 77.2-85.1 years, depending on
    income percentile). Among individuals with a mental disorder, the subgroup
    in the top 3% of the income distribution had the longest average life
    expectancy (77.0 years), and this estimate was lower than the shortest life
    expectancy in the general Danish population (77.2 years for individuals in
    the bottom 6% income distribution). The mortality rate differences were
    larger in the low-income than the high-income group (19.6 vs. 13.3 per 1,000
    person-years). For natural causes of death, a socioeconomic gradient for
    differences in life expectancy and mortality rates was observed across most
    diagnoses, both sexes, and all age groups. For external causes, no such
    gradient was observed. In the low-SEP group, 10.1% of all deaths and 23.7%
    of those related to external causes were attributable to mental disorders,
    compared with 3.5% and 8.7% in the high-SEP group. Thus, our data indicate
    that people with mental disorders have a shorter life expectancy even than
    people with the lowest SEP in the general population. The socioeconomic
    gradients in mortality rates due to natural causes highlight a greater need
    for coordinated care of physical diseases in people with mental disorders
    and low SEP.

    This article examines the context of growing up in rural America and how
    rural roots shape life chances. The distinctive physical, social, and
    cultural attributes of rural areas can exacerbate many of the challenges of
    childhood poverty. Yet rural children have better access to public childcare
    services and perform as well as urban children on standardized tests. Life
    trajectories diverge most sharply when rural youths decide whether to leave
    their home communities. Those who stay typically face limited opportunities
    for higher education and well-paid, stable employment, whereas those who
    leave fare remarkably well with respect to their educational, economic, and
    health outcomes. In sum, growing up in rural America offers distinctive
    advantages and disadvantages, yet the benefits may accrue primarily to those
    who leave.

    BACKGROUND: For policy questions where substantial empirical background
    information exists, conventional frequentist policy analysis is hard to
    justify. Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but
    is not often used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016
    data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past
    empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat
    belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation
    approach to combine information from prior studies with
    difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated
    evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt
    laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past
    studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent
    policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary
    enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles
    traveled (95% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95%
    posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents
    reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95% posterior
    interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24).
    CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian methods can provide credible estimates of future
    policy impacts, especially for policy questions that occur in dynamic
    environments, such as traffic safety.

    In recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated,
    followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in
    absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research
    interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the
    decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the
    proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths,
    suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer's disease. A slowdown in the long-term
    decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life
    expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the
    decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations,
    recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death
    are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in
    overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent
    deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently
    needed to improve mortality in the United States.

    Background The Tabora Maternal and Newborn Health Initiative project was a
    multicomponent intervention to improve maternal and newborn health in the
    Tabora region of Tanzania. Components included training healthcare providers
    and community health workers, infrastructure upgrades, and improvements to
    health management. This study aimed to examine the impact of trainings on
    four key outcomes: skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, respectful
    maternity care and patient–provider communication.

    Methods Trainings were delivered sequentially at four time points between
    2018 and 2019 in eight districts (two districts at a time). Cross-sectional
    surveys were administered to a random sample of households in all districts
    at baseline and after each training wave. Due to practical necessities, the
    original stepped wedge cluster randomised design of the evaluation was
    altered mid-programme. Therefore, a difference-in-differences for multiple
    groups in multiple periods was adopted to compare outcomes in treated
    districts to not yet treated districts. Risk differences were estimated for
    the overall average treatment effect on the treated and group/time dynamic
    effects.

    Results Respondents reported 3895 deliveries over the course of the study.
    The intervention was associated with a 12.9 percentage point increase in
    skilled birth attendance (95% CI 0.4 to 25.4), which began to increase 4
    months after the end of training in each district. There was little evidence
    of impact on antenatal care visits, respectful treatment during delivery and
    patient–provider communication.

    Conclusion Interventions to train local healthcare workers in basic and
    comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care increased skilled birth
    attendance but had limited impact on other pregnancy-related outcomes.

    preterm infants, but their use during late preterm gestation (34–36 weeks)
    is limited because their safety for longer-term child neurodevelopment is
    unclear. We sought to determine if fetuses with higher probability of
    exposure to antenatal corticosteroids had increased rates of prescriptions
    for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication in childhood,
    using a quasiexperimental design that better controls for confounding than
    existing observational studies.

    Methods: We identified 16 358 children whose birthing parents were admitted
    for delivery between 31 + 0 (31 weeks, 0 days) and 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation
    in 2000–2013, using a perinatal data registry from British Columbia, Canada,
    and linked their records with population-based child ADHD medication data
    (2000–2018). We used a regression discontinuity design to capitalize on the
    fact that pregnancies presenting for delivery immediately before and
    immediately after the clinical cut-off for antenatal corticosteroid
    administration of 34 + 0 weeks’ gestation have very different levels of
    exposure to corticosteroids, but are otherwise similar with respect to
    confounders.

    Results: Over a median follow-up period of 9 years, 892 (5.5%) children had
    1 or more dispensations of ADHD medication. Children whose birthing parents
    were admitted for delivery just before the corticosteroid clinical cut-off
    of 34 + 0 weeks’ gestation did not appear to be more likely to be prescribed
    ADHD medication than those admitted just after the cut-off (rate ratio 1.1,
    95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 1.6; 1.3 excess cases per 100 children,
    95% CI −2.5 to 5.7).

    Interpretation: We found little evidence that children with higher
    probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids have higher rates of
    ADHD prescriptions in childhood, supporting the safety of antenatal
    corticosteroids for this neurodevelopmental outcome.

    Effects of a coal to clean heating policy on acute myocardial infarction in
    Beijing: a difference-in-differences analysis

  abstract: >-
    The coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in China is thought to have reduced air
    pollution emissions due to reduced human mobility and economic activities.
    Few studies have assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on community and indoor
    air quality in environments with diverse socioeconomic and household energy
    use patterns. The main goal of this study was to evaluate whether indoor and
    community air pollution differed before, during, and after the COVID-19
    lockdown in homes with different energy use patterns. Using calibrated
    real-time PM2.5 sensors, we measured indoor and community air quality in 147
    homes from 30 villages in Beijing over 4 months including periods before,
    during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Community pollution was higher
    during the lockdown (61 ± 47 μg/m3) compared with before (45 ± 35 μg/m3, p <
    0.001) and after (47 ± 37 μg/m3, p < 0.001) the lockdown. However, we did
    not observe significantly increased indoor PM2.5 during the COVID-19
    lockdown. Indoor-generated PM2.5 in homes using clean energy for heating
    without smokers was the lowest compared with those using solid fuel
    with/without smokers, implying air pollutant emissions are reduced in homes
    using clean energy. Indoor air quality may not have been impacted by the
    COVID-19 lockdown in rural settings in China and appeared to be more
    impacted by the household energy choice and indoor smoking than the COVID-19
    lockdown. As clean energy transitions occurred in rural households in
    northern China, our work highlights the importance of understanding multiple
    possible indoor sources to interpret the impacts of interventions, intended
    or otherwise.

    The Chinese government implemented a national household energy transition
    program that replaced residential coal heating stoves with
    electricity-powered heat pumps for space heating in northern China. As part
    of a baseline assessment of the program, this study investigated variability
    in personal air pollution exposures within villages and between villages and
    evaluated exposure patterns by sociodemographic factors. We randomly
    recruited 446 participants in 50 villages in four districts in rural Beijing
    and measured 24 h personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and
    black carbon (BC). The geometric mean personal exposure to PM2.5 and BC was
    72 and 2.5 μg/m3, respectively. The variability in PM2.5 and BC exposures
    was greater within villages than between villages. Study participants who
    used traditional stoves as their dominant source of space heating were
    exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5 and BC. Wealthier households tended
    to burn more coal for space heating, whereas less wealthy households used
    more biomass. PM2.5 and BC exposures were almost uniformly distributed by
    socioeconomic status. Future work that combines these results with PM2.5
    chemical composition analysis will shed light on whether air pollution
    source contributors (e.g., industrial, traffic, and household solid fuel
    burning) follow similar distributions.

    This article reviews 98 aggregate and multilevel studies examining the
    associations between income inequality and health. Overall, there seems to
    be little support for the idea that income inequality is a major,
    generalizable determinant of population health differences within or between
    rich countries. Income inequality may, however, directly influence some
    health outcomes, such as homicide in some contexts. The strongest evidence
    for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even
    that is somewhat mixed. Despite little support for a direct effect of income
    inequality on health per se, reducing income inequality by raising the
    incomes of the most disadvantaged will improve their health, help reduce
    health inequalities, and generally improve population health.

    Background Starting in 2006 to 2007, the Government of Bangladesh
    implemented the Maternal Health Voucher Scheme (MHVS). This program provides
    pregnant women with vouchers that can be exchanged for health services from
    eligible public and private sector providers. In this study, we examined
    whether access to the MHVS was associated with maternal health services
    utilization, stillbirth, and neonatal and infant mortality. Methods and
    findings We used information on pregnancies and live births between 2000 to
    2016 reported by women 15 to 49 years of age surveyed as part of the
    Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys. Our analytic sample included
    23,275 pregnancies lasting at least 7 months for analyses of stillbirth and
    between 15,125 and 21,668 live births for analyses of health services use,
    neonatal, and infant mortality. With respect to live births occurring prior
    to the introduction of the MHVS, 31.3%, 14.1%, and 18.0% of women,
    respectively, reported receiving at least 3 antenatal care visits,
    delivering in a health institution, and having a skilled birth attendant at
    delivery. Rates of neonatal and infant mortality during this period were 40
    and 63 per 1,000 live births, respectively, and there were 32 stillbirths
    per 1,000 pregnancies lasting at least 7 months. We applied a
    difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of providing
    subdistrict-level access to the MHVS program, with inverse probability of
    treatment weights to address selection into the program. The introduction of
    the MHVS program was associated with a lagged improvement in the probability
    of delivering in a health facility, one of the primary targets of the
    program, although associations with other health services were less evident.
    After 6 years of access to the MHVS, the probabilities of reporting at least
    3 antenatal care visits, delivering in a health facility, and having a
    skilled birth attendant present increased by 3.0 [95% confidence interval
    (95% CI) = −4.8, 10.7], 6.5 (95% CI = −0.6, 13.6), and 5.8 (95% CI = −1.8,
    13.3) percentage points, respectively. We did not observe evidence
    consistent with the program improving health outcomes, with probabilities of
    stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and infant mortality decreasing by 0.7 (95%
    CI = −1.3, 2.6), 0.8 (95% CI = −1.7, 3.4), and 1.3 (95% CI = −2.5, 5.1)
    percentage points, respectively, after 6 years of access to the MHVS. The
    sample size was insufficient to detect smaller associations with adequate
    precision. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of measurement
    error, although it was likely nondifferential by treatment group, or
    unmeasured confounding by concomitant interventions that were implemented
    differentially in treated and control areas. Conclusions In this study, we
    found that the introduction of the MHVS was positively associated with the
    probability of delivering in a health facility, but despite a longer period
    of follow-up than most extant evaluations, we did not observe attendant
    reductions in stillbirth, neonatal mortality, or infant mortality. Further
    work and engagement with stakeholders is needed to assess if the MHVS has
    affected the quality of care and health inequalities and whether the design
    and eligibility of the program should be modified to improve maternal and
    neonatal health outcomes.

    Background

    Women in India are often responsible for unpaid household work, family
    caregiving, and paid work, which can contribute to poorer mental health. The
    provision of childcare has the potential to improve women’s mental health,
    but evidence on the effects of providing access to daycare is limited.


    Methods

    We designed a cluster-randomised trial and used data from a sample of 2858
    mothers with age-eligible children from 160 village hamlets in rural
    Rajasthan, India, to evaluate the impact of providing access to a
    community-based daycare programme on social and emotional aspects of women’s
    mental health. We conducted a baseline survey in early 2016, randomised
    hamlets to intervention or control groups approximately six months later,
    and delivered the final post-intervention survey approximately two years
    thereafter.


    Results

    Treatment assignment increased the probability that a respondent used a
    daycare over the two-year follow-up by 40.9 percentage points. Providing
    randomised access to a daycare resulted in 0.2 (95% confidence interval
    (CI) = −0.1, 0.4) fewer symptoms of mental distress, representing a 9.5%
    decline compared to the baseline mean of 2.1 symptoms, as well as a 3.7 (95%
    CI = −0.8, 8.3) percentage point increase in the proportion of women who
    reported feeling very happy, equivalent to an 11.0% increase relative to the
    baseline mean of 33.6%. Among social indicators, treatment assignment was
    associated with a 5.6 (95% CI = −1.2, 12.4) percentage point increase in
    membership in an association, a relative increase of 43.4% compared to the
    baseline mean of 12.9%. The intervention did not have an appreciable impact
    on measures of life satisfaction or trust in institutions. Two-stage least
    squares instrumental variable analyses showed that daycare use decreased
    mental distress by 0.4 (95% CI = −0.1, 0.8) symptoms, increased the
    proportion of women who were very happy by 9.4 (95% CI = 0.0, 17.6)
    percentage points, and increased membership in an organisation by 15.9 (95%
    CI = 8.4, 23.7) percentage points.


    Conclusions

    The provision of affordable, community-based daycare was associated with
    substantial uptake and showed potential for improving mothers’ mental health
    in a rural context where most women were not employed in the formal labour
    force.

  abstract: "Treatment effects can be measured on the relative scale (eg, risk ratios, odds ratios) or the absolute scale (eg, risk differences). If the baseline risk of an outcome is different between subgroups, the effect of the treatment will differ between subgroups on at least one scale (relative, absolute, or both). We illustrate this using two examples from the literature where only relative effects were estimated, but conclusions about subgroup differences would likely have changed had absolute effects also been considered. To identify all meaningful subgroup differences, researchers and clinicians should compare\_effects on the relative and absolute scale."

In adjusted models, a 1 °C increase in indoor temperature was associated with decreased SBP [−0.4 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.7 to −0.1 (between-individual; brachial and central BP); −0.5 mmHg, 95% CI: −0.8 to −0.2 (within-individual, brachial BP); −0.4 mmHg, 95% CI: −0.7 to −0.2 (within-individual, central BP)], DBP [−0.2 mmHg, 95% CI:−0.4 to −0.03 (between-individual); −0.3 mmHg, 95% CI: −0.5 to −0.04 (within-individual)], and within-individual pulse pressure [−0.2 mmHg, 95% CI: −0.4 to −0.04 (central); −0.3 mmHg, 95% CI: −0.4 to −0.1 (brachial)]. Between-individual SBP estimates were larger among participants with hypertension. There was no evidence of an effect of outdoor temperature on BP.\n          Conclusion:\_\n          Our results support previous findings of inverse associations between indoor temperature and BP but contrast with prior evidence of an inverse relationship with outdoor temperature. Wintertime home heating may be a population-wide intervention strategy for high BP and cardiovascular disease in China."

    Introduction

    There is substantial debate concerning the impact of cannabis
    decriminalization and legalization on road safety outcomes.

    Methods

    Seven databases were systematically searched: Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO
    through Ovid as well as Web of Science Core Collection, SafetyLit, Criminal
    Justice Database (ProQuest), and Transport Research International
    Documentation (from inception to June 16, 2021). Eligible primary studies
    examined group-level cannabis decriminalization or legalization and a road
    safety outcome in any population.

    Results

    A total of 65 reports of 64 observational studies were eligible, including
    39 that applied a quasi-experimental design. Studies examined recreational
    cannabis legalization (n=50), medical cannabis legalization (n=22), and
    cannabis decriminalization (n=5). All studies except 1 used data from the
    U.S. or Canada. Studies found mixed impacts of legalization on attitudes,
    beliefs, and self-reported driving under the influence. Medical
    legalization, recreational legalization, and decriminalization were
    associated with increases in positive cannabis tests among drivers. Few
    studies examined impacts on alcohol or other drug use, although findings
    suggested a decrease in positive alcohol tests among drivers associated with
    medical legalization. Medical legalization was associated with reductions in
    fatal motor-vehicle collisions, whereas recreational legalization was
    conversely associated with increases in fatal collisions.

    Discussion

    Increased cannabis positivity may reflect changes in cannabis use; however,
    it does not in itself indicate increased impaired driving. Subgroups
    impacted by medical and recreational legalization, respectively, likely
    explain opposing findings for fatal collisions. More research is needed
    concerning cannabis decriminalization; the impacts of decriminalization and
    legalization on nonfatal injuries, alcohol and other drugs; and the
    mechanisms by which legalization impacts road safety outcomes.
