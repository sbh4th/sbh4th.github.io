      <description>Weakly informative priors are an appealing modeling technique where the modeler identifies appropriate scales in a given analysis and uses those scales to introduce principled regularization into the analysis. Exactly how those scales are utilized, however, is not explicitly defined. Consequently the actual implementation of weakly informative priors can be ambiguous for practitioners.
In this case study I will consider two approaches for implementing weakly informative priors and demonstrate each effects the resulting analysis.</description>

      <description>This Friday is April 20th, a day that for most people means nothing. Americans are relieved at having filed their taxes, Canadians are stressed in anticipation of filing theirs, and in Montreal we are still wondering if winter will ever end. However, for a small minority of people, April 20th (or 4&amp;frasl;20) is a day of celebration of all things cannabis, with large outdoor gatherings where cannabis consumption is promoted, especially at 4:20pm.</description>
