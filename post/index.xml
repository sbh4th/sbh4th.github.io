      <description>Background Last fall Adam Palayew and I wrote about an interesting paper that claimed that the number of people in fatal traffic crashes increased by 12% on April the 20th. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, April 20th (or &amp;lsquo;420&amp;rsquo;) is a day of celebration of all things cannabis, with large outdoor gatherings where cannabis consumption is promoted, especially at 4:20pm. The idea behind the paper was that excess consumption of cannabis on April 20th led to more drugged driving, and therefore more fatal accidents.</description>
