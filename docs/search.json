    "text": "Research Activities\nMy research focuses on investigating how social and environmental factors impact health outcomes and health inequalities. My work is interdisciplinary, combining epidemiological methods with social science approaches to gain insights into the complex interactions between health and society. My research covers a wide variety of topics, but my major areas of focus are:\n\n\nMethods for measuring health inequalities. Measuring and monitoring health inequalities are crucial activites for providing evidence on the impact of medical interventions and policies on vulnerable populations, and for testing the plausibility of etiologic factors that may influence social differences in health. My work takes a systematic approach to health inequality measurement and emphasizes the importance that extra-scientific value judgments play in interpreting evidence on the magnitude and trends of health inequalities.\n\n\nAnalysis of life expectancy trends. Life expectancy is a fundamental and well-established measure of overall population health. I have made extensive use of demographic techniques for decomposing changes in life expectancy between social groups as a tool for generating evidence on the causes of health inequalities.\n\n\nExperimental and quasi-experimental approaches to health inequalities. I use randomized interventions and plausibly random changes in social and economic policies to estimate the causal effects of exposures on population health and health inequalities. I have used econometric techniques such as difference-in-differences and instrumental variables to estimate the health effects of medical marijuana laws, mandatory seat belt laws, and the Great Recession in the USA, user-fees in sub-Saharan Africa, and tobacco policies in Canada."

We are all here to learn from one another, and this course simply won’t work without engagement and participation from all of us (including me). Of course, everyone has their own level of comfort speaking up, as well as varying levels of interest in some of these topics, so I have no expectation that everyone participates equally. What I do ask is that you make a sincere effort to engage with the material, both in terms of the reading and in the discussion forum. Learning how to respectfully express your opinion about conceptual and methodological issues is a core part of being a scientist."

Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit two critical essays that explore a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science.These may be direct responses to material that we read or discuss in class, or they may be essays exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate good-faith efforts to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 1500 words. The first one is due on October 22, 2020 and the second one is due on December 7, 2020. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to.\n\n\nClass Participation\nIn addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead one day of discussion among the topics that we will cover. For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic."

To facilitate student engagement with the reading we will use the online tool Perusall for all required readings. Perusall is a reading platform in which students annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available here (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content &gt; Perusall (readings) &gt; Perusall, and then click the “Open Link” button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall’s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion."

    "text": "A Note About Class Participation\nParticipation means showing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion in Perusall, and bring those to class. During the discussion period in class participation means asking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable, offering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class."

In an effort to make this course as dynamic and helpful to students as possible, the list of topics and reading below is subject to change.

To facilitate student engagement with the reading we will use the online tool Perusall for all required readings. Perusall is a reading platform in which students (and faculty) annotate texts collaboratively alongside one another. More information on how Perusall works and how it is integrated into the course is available here (thank you Arizona State!). To access Perusall through MyCourses, navigate to Content &gt; Readings &gt; Perusall, and then click the “Open Link” button. This will take you to the Perusall site and automatically register you as a member of the course. If you are having any trouble accessing the readings through Perusall contact me right away. I will not be using Perusall’s grading features, but I expect you to read, post questions, respond to other students questions and answers, and to take an active role in generating productive discussion."

    "text": "4.2 Writing\nThe discussions in the course are meant to activate your critical thinking skills, and to encourage you to synthesize your own thoughts on the material, particularly as it may relate to your area of research interest. Toward that end, over the course of the semester you will be asked to submit one original, critical essay that explores a topic of relevance to epidemiologic science. It may be a direct response to material that we read or discuss in class, or it may be an essay exploring other topics relevant to your work that demonstrate a good-faith effort to engage with the class material. These should take the form of a commentary similar (in spirit) to those we have read during the semester, and should be no longer than 2500 words. An outline of the essay, including the basic arguments you want to make, is due on March 10, 2023 and the final essay is due on April 19, 2023. I will provide examples of what I think are good pieces of writing to aspire to."

    "text": "4.3 Engagement\n\nLeading Discussion\nIn addition to the writing assignment, each student will be asked to lead at least one day of discussion among the topics that we will cover (and probably more than one for most of you). For that session, you will come prepared to briefly summarize the material we have read, and to prepare some discussion points to help keep the conversation moving. I have created a Google spreadsheet with the current days for each topic here. Please sign-up for a session and we can have a discussion about the readings and where to draw on other resources for the topic. Note: We have 25 sessions and 14 students this year, so not everyone is required to lead 2 sessions. You should be able to sort this out, but if the remaining slots don’t get filled I will happily assign them.\nAlthough each class session is 1.5 hours, there will inevitably be topics that come up that we can’t fully address in class. I encourage you to use the Discussion section of MyCourses to post questions or comments there. In past years I have also used this as a place to occassionally post links to additional readings for those interested.\n\n\nParticipation\nReal engagement means active participation. This can take many forms, but for some general guidance, this means:\n\nShowing up for each class having read and engaged with the material assigned. It will help facilitate discussion if you could aim to contribute at least 2-3 points for discussion or questions about the material in Perusall, and bring those to class;\nFocusing during class discussion and avoiding distractions, and being present and intellectually engaged during the discussion;\nAsking questions about anything in the readings that seems unclear or objectionable (in class, outside class, online). This can include both specific ideas from the readings, as well as synthesizing or finding themes common to different readings or our discussion;\nOffering respectful arguments and responses, and respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others. Contributions should be relevant and helpful and demonstrate that you are engaging with the material being discussed at the time, and that you are well-prepared for class."

    "text": "6.1 Week 1: What is the present and future of epidemiology as a discipline?\nWhy are we doing this?\nBecause this is not a didactic course that is focused on learning methods or technical skills, and because in the past this course has often been critiqued for not providing a solid rationale for why it even exists, I owe it to you to provide some justification for the topics and readings I’ve chosen, as well as for why I think this material would be useful for your doctoral training. For each set of assigned material (the ‘What’), I’ve included a brief rationale (the ‘Why’). I hope you find it helpful.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-04: Course introduction\n\nAdministrative aspects of the course.\nRound table – introductions.\nDiscussion of objectives and competencies.\n\nIn the first session we will talk generally about high-level questions regarding the discipline of epidemiology as a whole. Although you are early on in your training, I think it is valuable for you to be aware of these broader discussions about where the field stands in relation to its past, and what the appropriate balance should be between descriptive, causal, or implementation questions. Having some knowledge about the intellectual history of different concepts (“risk factor epidemiology”, “consequential epidemiology”) will help you to figure out where your own work stands in relation to the discipline as a whole.\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-06: Reflections on epidemiology’s past and present\n\nWhat:\n\nDavey Smith G. Post–Modern Epidemiology: When Methods Meet Matter. Am J Epidemiol 2019;188(8):1410–1419. [link] [8601 words]\nLesko CR, Keil AP, Edwards JK. The Epidemiologic Toolbox: Identifying, Honing, and Using the Right Tools for the Job. Am J Epidemiol 2020;189(6):511–517. [link] [3675 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe Davey Smith paper provides a bit of historical orientation to the ‘modern’ epidemiology training you are getting, as well as a critique of it in relation to epidemiology’s past. I chose the Lesko et al. paper because it focuses on the relationship between the tools of epidemiology (about which you are learning a lot in this first year) and the kinds of questions that can be answered with those tools. In particular, they focus on differences between purely descriptive questions, questions about synthesized evidence on causal relationships, and questions about specific interventions for which we want to estimate a causal effect. I also like that it was written by early career researchers whose training is in many ways similar to your own."

Is ‘novelty’ more important than making incremental progress? Should it matter whether a given question will produce ‘actionable’ evidence? And is it problematic if a study’s methods are not well aligned with the question it seeks to answer? Is it wasteful (or, even unethical) to produce such work?\n\nWednesday 2023-01-11: Does it matter whether questions and methods align?\n\nWhat:\n\nFox MP, Murray EJ, Lesko CR, Sealy-Jefferson S.

A Second Chance to Get Causal Inference Right: A Classification of Data Science Tasks. CHANCE 2019; 32:1, 42-49. [link] [5650 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWhat is the relationship between research questions and methods? Should we just use multivariable regression for everything? Does it actually matter? Fox et al. argue for the importance and need to reinvigorate descriptive epidemiology, and make a case that this has particular consequences for both theory and methods. The paper by Hernan and colleagues tries to lay out how questions and methods should be aligned in empirical data science research. This paper was written when enthusiasm for machine learning and other empirical data science algorithms began achieving a high degree of influence, and their paper aims to try and clarify the utility of being clear about the question being asked, the methods used to answer it, and the role of expert knowledge in generating the result.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-13: What makes a ‘good’ question?\n\nWhat:\n\nBanack H.

How will you decide what questions to answer with your work, and how will you evaluate the questions others are asking?"

    "section": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?",
    "text": "6.3 Week 3: How important is formal causal inference?\nMuch of modern epidemiologic training now starts with the introduction of potential outcomes framework, as well as introducing DAGs as a way to draw and consider assumptions needed for doing causal inference. What are the implications of using these frameworks for the kinds of questions that can be asked and answered in epidemiology? Do we risk restricting ourselves to ‘formal’ methods when it comes to causal questions, or are other alternatives possible? These are fundamental questions about the nature of epidemiologic inquiry, and it is useful for you to consider the benefits and drawbacks that may come with adopting this epistemological stance. As you progress in your training, you’ll need to decide on how you will approach questions of causal inference both in your own work and in your evaluations of the wider epidemiologic literature.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-18: Are potential outcomes and DAGs necessary?\n\nWhat:\n\nKrieger N, Davey Smith G. The tale wagged by the DAG: broadening the scope of causal inference and explanation for epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1787–1808. [link] [15714 words]\nDaniel RM, De Stavola BL, Vansteelandt S. Commentary: The formal approach to quantitative causal inference in epidemiology: misguided or misrepresented? Int J Epidemiol. 2016 12;45(6):1817–1829. [link] [10561 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe first set of papers for this session come from an older, but still relevant “debate” about the utility and consequences of the “formal” approach to causal inference in epidemiology, which you likely now take for granted, since that is what most ‘modern’ epi programs teach (including ours). Krieger/Davey Smith are asking critical questions of potential outcomes and DAGs (the latter was also the editor at IJE at the time, hence the ‘relaxed’ approach to word limits), and Daniel et al. defending, more or less the modern approach. Look forward to hearing your thoughts.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-20: Are well-defined interventions needed for causal questions?\n\nWhat:\n\nSchwartz S, Gatto NM, Campbell UB. Causal identification: a charge of epidemiology in danger of marginalization. Ann Epidemiol 2016;26(10):669-673. [link]. [4069 words]\nHernan MA. Does water kill?

Heeding the call for less casual causal inferences: the utility of realized (quantitative) causal effects. Ann Epidemiol 2017;27(6):402-405. [link]. [2756 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second set of readings for this week is meant to engage with a more specific critique of ‘modern’ causal inference methods, namely, the notion that ‘good’ causal questions are based on well-defined interventions. This is a more recent argument, largely associated with Miguel Hernan and linked to the idea of using ‘target trials’ to formulate questions for observational studies.\nAs academics are wont to do, there has been some pushback against this idea, notably by Sharon Schwartz, another long-term and thoughtful critic of epidemiology (see her nice 1999 pre-causal-inference-revolution paper in Am J Public Health on the consequences of what she called, ‘Type III error’ which is about asking the wrong question). She and other critics are pushing back against this idea and trying to understand it’s implications (again) for the kinds of causal questions we can answer (and note that I think this is a different sort of critique than was being made by Krieger/Davey Smith)."

    "text": "6.4 Week 4: How should we study non-manipulable exposures?\nLongstanding debates about whether exposures that are not directly (or perhaps even theoretically) manipulable, such as race, ethnicity, sex, or country-of-birth, present important challenges for the counterfactual models of causal inference you have been learning about. This set of readings aims to try and clarify some of these conceptual questions and derive potential paths forward that respect the “rules” of causal inference but that can also provide evidence that may be useful for reducing differences in health across non-manipulable factors.\n\nWednesday 2023-01-25: Are non-manipulable exposures causes?\n\nWhat:\n\nVanderWeele TJ, Robinson WR. On the causal interpretation of race in regressions adjusting for confounding and mediating variables. Epidemiology 2014 Jul;25(4):473–84. [link] [11470 words]\nGlymour MM, Spiegelman D.

[link] [3446 words]\nBoyd RW et al. On Racism: A New Standard For Publishing On Racial Health Inequities. Health Affairs Blog, July 2, 2020. [link] [2378 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe paper by Vanderweele and Robinson tries to address the issue of non-manipulable exposures (specifically race) in a way that respects the complexity of this kind of exposure, but attempts to move forward to see whether it is helpful to reframe the question to how interventions on factors plausibly affected by race may affect racial differences in health. Meanwhile, Glymour and Spiegelman offer more of a defense of the idea that non-manipulable factors are causes and deserve the same kind of consideration and treatment as other exposures we study routinely in epidemiology. Finally, the blog post by Boyd is a relatively new piece making strong arguments for how race should be reported and interpreted in epidemiologic and clinical studies.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-01-27: Case study: race in clinical treatment.\n\nWhat:\n\nVyas DA, Eisenstein LG, Jones DS. Hidden in Plain Sight — Reconsidering the Use of Race Correction in Clinical Algorithms. New Engl J Med 2020;383(9):874–82. [link] [6251 words]\nManski CF. Patient-centered appraisal of race-free clinical risk assessment. Health Econ 2022;31(10):2109–14. [link] [4133 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nTaking a bit of a break from conceptual readings on questions and causal inference, in the second session we delve into a case study of the challenges in the use of race in clinical medicine. Should we use race as a factor in recommending treatments to patients? Does it matter whether or not race is a cause of the outcome, or whether including race might affect inequalities? The two papers from Vyas et al. and Manski arrive at different arguments regarding whether or not race should be included, and I think they provide a rich set of issues to discuss that complement the arguments about how we should study non-manipulable exposures in epidemiology."

    "text": "6.5 Week 5: Should we try to randomize interventions?\nOkay, we’ve talked about the role of asking good questions, whether non-manipulable factors are causes and ways to investigate them, and whether we need well-specified interventions for causal questions, but let’s now turn toward more practical concerns (ha). You want to study intervention \\(X\\), which is not known to be either harmful or beneficial, can be ethically and feasibly delivered, and has plausible reasons why it should affect \\(Y\\). What kind of design should you use? Should you try and design a randomized evaluation? What would be the benefits? What drawbacks? What implications for external generalizability or understanding the mechanisms through which it may affect \\(Y\\)?\n\nWednesday 2023-02-01: Are RCT’s special?\n\nWhat:\n\nDeaton A, Cartwright N. Understanding and misunderstanding randomized controlled trials. Soc Sci Med 2018;210:2–21. [link] [22882 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDeaton and Cartwright’s paper provides an overview of core philosophical, conceptual, and statistical concepts of randomized trials, and a lot of comments on their benefits and drawbacks. Haushofer and Metcalf apply questions about the feasibility to our pandemic circumstances (though it seems a long time ago that they published this in May of 2020, before viable vaccines, before new strains, before second, third, omicron waves). As epidemiologists, I think you will benefit from getting into the weeds a bit about randomized designs and grappling with questions about when and where they might be appropriate.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-03: What if we can’t randomize?\n\nWhat:\n\nLodi S, Phillips A, Lundgren J, Logan R, Sharma S, Cole SR, et al. Effect Estimates in Randomized Trials and Observational Studies: Comparing Apples With Apples. Am J Epidemiol 2019 08;188(8):1569–1577. [link] [3044 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite some important strengths of randomized designs, especially for exchangeability, in some cases it just won’t be feasible or ethical to pursue a randomized design. What then? Anything goes? Just plug all the confounders into your regression and hope for the best? There are still good reasons to consider thinking conceptually about the trial you would design if feasibility and ethical issues were irrelevant, and then attempting to pursue an observational design that corresponds as closely as possible to your hypothetical “target trial”.\nLodi et al. are really focused on comparing results from an observational study to a trial that both investigate the same question, and their paper shows a practical example of how you might think about approaching this question (I would say even if you don’t have trial data). Nevertheless, this design still focuses almost entirely on regression adjustment as a way of achieving exchangeability–a rather strong assumption, and one that may be difficult to sell to critics."

It is important that we obtain a random sample of our target population, or can we use a convenience sample? And how does this change depending on the goal of our study, i.e., to estimate a prevalence versus develop a prediction model versus estimate a causal effect?\n\nWednesday 2023-02-08: Should our studies be representative?\n\nWhat:\n\nRothman KJ, Gallacher JEJ, Hatch EE.

Epidemiology 2021;32:179–188. [link] [6921 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDebates about whether studies designed to estimate causal effects need to be representative, or alternatively should purposefully be designed not to be representative, have been persistent in epidemiology, but have also become more pressing given increasing concerns for generalizability. This paper by Rothman arguing that causal studies should avoid representative samples created a bit of a stir a few years ago, and has produced some additional empirical work on how much this matters. These issues are important for when you are both producing and consuming research, and it will be worthwhile to struggle a bit with them. I’ve also included a recent empirical piece that attempts to assess the quantitative consequences for a specific set of exposures and outcomes.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-10: Case study: COVID-19 vaccine uptake\n\nWhat:\n\nBradley VC et al. Unrepresentative Big Surveys Significantly Overestimated US Vaccine Uptake.

Do the consequences actually matter? A very recent paper by Bradley on vaccine uptake surveys provides an example to discuss in the second session."

    "text": "6.7 Week 7: How should we make statistical inferences?\nThis question probably won’t go away over the course of your PhD training, or in the near future, so it is important to grapple with it. What are the consequences of the way we currently teach and use p-values (or 95% confidence intervals), how does it affect the way you read and interpret evidence? Should we banish the term “statistically significant” and, if so, why? How will you argue against peer reviewers and journal editors (or even your supervisors) that demand you include p-values (or, even worse, stars for levels of ‘significance’) in your revisions? This is a core issue of moving from sampled data and analysis to the kind of inferences you will make about causal effects. How will you approach it?\n\nThursday Wednesday 2023-02-15: How should we use p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nWasserstein RL, Schirm AL, Lazar NA. Moving to a world beyond “p&lt;0.05”. The American Statistician 2019;73(sup1):1–19. [link]. [10923 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nWasserstein et al. provide a series of arguments for abandoning p-value thresholds, some of which you are likely to have heard before, but there is much more in this paper. They make a number of positive arguments for how we should be conducting inference, and interpreting the results of research, and they aim to try and provide solid foundations for being more thoughtful about how to interpret evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-17: What are alternatives to p-values?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenland S, Mansournia MA, Joffe M. To curb research misreporting, replace significance and confidence by compatibility. Prev Med 2022;164:107127.

NEJM Evidence. 2022;2(1):EVIDoa2200196. [link] [7203 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGiven the Wasserstein paper’s suggestion to abandon statistical significance, questions naturally arise about how we should do inference instead of using p-values. Most epidemiologists are trained to use confidence intervals rather than p-values, but it does not appear to have changed the basic problem of scientists dichotomizing evidence using arbitrary statistical rules. These papers attempt to provide some alternative avenues to explore. Greenland et al. continue their quest to promote notions of ‘compatibility’ rather than significance. I included the Harhay et al. paper because it shows how to provide a more nuanced interpretation of a ‘non-significant’ RCT using straightforward Bayesian inference. This should get you thinking about how you will manage your inferences in your own research"

These ideas are crucial for thinking about testing alternative explanations for observed findings, and quantifying the assumptions needed to do so.\n\nWednesday 2023-02-22: How can we quantify our assumptions?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Fox MP, MacLehose RF, Maldonado G, McCandless LC, Greenland S. Good practices for quantitative bias analysis. Int J Epidemiol 2014;43(6):1969–85. [link] [12518 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nLash et al. provide a long overview of good practices for such bias analysis, discussing both the motivation for why one would want to to conduct bias analysis and the mechanics of how to do so (choosing parameters, considering uncertainty). These methods are valuable for most study designs, but may be especially so for “garden variety” observational studies that must rely on basic regression adjustment to have any hope of making causal inferences.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-02-24: Can bias analysis be biased?\n\nWhat:\n\nLash TL, Ahern TP, Collin LJ, Fox MP, MacLehose RF. Bias Analysis Gone Bad. Am J Epidemiol 2021;190(8):1604–12. [link] [6451 words]\nGustafson P. To Bound or Not to Bound: Is That the Question? Epid 2021;32(5):635–7. [link] [2191 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nAlthough sensitivity analysis has been around a long time, quantitative bias analysis continues to be rare, and perhaps one explanation is that it asks a lot from researchers. Other options may include using simple bounds to answer questions about how bad things would have to be to ‘nullify’ an effect, but replacing ignoring assumptions with absurd assumptions leaves much to be desired. Lash et al. demonstrate how to do bias analysis ‘better’ and what can go wrong when it is not done with care. Gustafson, in a comment on some other papers, provides an interesting hypothetical set of scenarios for different ways of combining different study designs and strategies for accounting for bias. I hope you can come away with an appreciation and understanding of why such analyses are valuable."

Generalizing Study Results: A Potential Outcomes Perspective. Epidemiology 2017;28:553–561. [link] [6631 words]\nWestreich D, Edwards JK, Lesko CR, Cole SR, Stuart EA. Target Validity and the Hierarchy of Study Designs. Am J Epidemiol 2019;188:438–443. [link] [5308 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nDespite the clear importance of considering to whom study results should apply, there has been little formal work on what assumptions are needed to derive quantitative estimates of effects in different external populations, whether those refer to the target population or a population that is external to the target. These two papers argue that we should consider these formal approaches, and provide some guidance as to what assumptions (and potentially data) would be needed to do so.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-10: Should we generalize to specific individuals?\n\nWhat:\n\nKhoury, MJ et al. The Intersection of Genomics and Big Data with Public Health: Opportunities for Precision Public Health. PLoS Medicine 2020;17: e1003373. [link] [7677 words]\nCooper R, Paneth N. Will precision medicine lead to a healthier population? Issues in Science and Technology 2020;36(2):64-71. [link] [6793 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second part of our readings on extending results to other populations reframes the question not about transporting results to a different sample, but about how to (and whether we can) derive reliable predictions about treatment effects at the individual level. This is related to ongoing discussions about the concepts of “precision” epidemiology or precision public health, and whether these ideas are really novel or just ways of re-branding what we have always considered in public health, which is targeting when it comes to interventions. There have emerged different ‘camps’ of those more and less enthusiastic about this idea, and these two papers are meant to provide an overview of some of these issues."

    "text": "6.11 Week 11: Is research (including epidemiology) reliable?\nThis week we are stepping away a bit from epidemiology only, and focusing on larger questions related potential problems that may be widespread across scientific research (obviously, including epidemiology). Can or should we trust most published research? Is it reliable? Is it replicable and, if not, is that really a problem? Many of these issues have come up in the context of something that has been called the “replication crisis” in science, much of which started when some high-profile lab and social science projects were found not to replicate using similar designs and methods.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-15: Is science broken?\n\nWhat:\n\nOliver, J. Scientific studies. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, Season 3, Episode 11, May 5, 2016 [link] [20 mins] Note: contains explicit and crude language\nBaker M. 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility. Nature 2016:533(7604):452–4. [link] [2002 words]\nPearson H. How COVID Broke the Evidence Pipeline. Nature 2021;593:182-5 [link] [3884 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe video by Oliver discusses wild claims, the propensity of such claims to be blown up by the media, as well as problems with incentives. Additional evidence on these issues comes from a survey of scientists reported in Nature across a broad number of fields, as well as a report by Pearson on how this has played out in research on the pandemic.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-17: What are some potential solutions?\n\nWhat:\n\nMunafo MR et al. A manifesto for reproducible science. Nature Human Behaviour 2017;1:1–9. [link] [9180 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second session features a long paper by Munafo et al. that is more focused on outlining and describing some potential solutions, including study pre-registration and pre-analysis plan, registered reports or ‘results-blind’ peer review, sharing of research materials, including data and code, and changing incentives around publication and grants - all core processes for modern working scientists."

    "text": "6.12 Week 12: How should we put together all of the evidence?\nThis week we are going to talk more about how to put together and think about diverse lines of evidence to come to some sort of judgement about causal effects. Most of you will have heard (and I agree) that it a single study is unlikely to be sufficient to generate certainty about a given exposure-outcome effect. There may be special circumstances (e.g, vaccine trials for COVID-19), but generally we are starting from a place where we have to consider various lines of argument and evidence to inform our thinking.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-22: Can “triangulation” help?\n\nWhat:\n\nLawlor DA, Tilling K, Davey Smith G. Triangulation in aetiological epidemiology. Int J Epidemiol 2016;45(6):1866–86. [link] [14610 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nYou may have seen various papers talk about the concept of ‘triangulation’ in thinking about evidence. The Lawlor et al. paper focuses on trying to pull together (sometimes by design) data sources that may trade off different kinds of biases in order to see whether results are consistent across various settings, but in a formal and methodological way. I encourage you to consider whether you think it is a useful approach.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-24: Does meta-analysis help or hurt?\n\nWhat:\n\nHilton Boon M, Burns J, Craig P, Griebler U, Heise TL, Vittal Katikireddi S, et al. Value and Challenges of Using Observational Studies in Systematic Reviews of Public Health Interventions. Am J Public Health 2022;112(4):548–52. [link] [3899 words]\nSavitz DA, Forastiere F. Do pooled estimates from meta-analyses of observational epidemiology studies contribute to causal inference? Occup Environ Med 2021;78(9):621–2. [link] [2029 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nMeta-analysis of a systematic review has become the dominant method for summarizing epidemiologic evidence, but comes with a large set of challenges, particularly for observational studies. These two papers provide an overview of some of the challenges of how these contribute to evidence, and whether they are ultimately useful for informing causal inference about the effects of exposures."

    "text": "6.13 Week 13: How should we communicate epidemiologic evidence?\nThis week we will be reading more about the (possible) tension between our duties as epidemiologic scientists to try and report evidence in a dispassionate way, and the sometimes pressing need for action to tackle pressing health problems when evidence is uncertain. The readings are from two seasoned epidemiologists and provide some overarching guidance thinking about how far to ‘push’ with your results, and what the benefits and drawbacks of different levels of engagement with the broader scientific community might be.\n\nWednesday 2023-03-29: How should we discuss epidemiologic results?\n\nWhat:\n\nSavitz DA, Wellenius GA. Characterization and Communication of Conclusions. In: Interpreting epidemiologic evidence: connecting research to applications. Oxford University Press; 2016. p. 200–10. [link] [5958 words]\nBlastland M et al. Five rules for evidence communication. Nature 2020;587:362–364 [link] [2664 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThe second session’s readings are focused more on how to grapple with and communicate uncertainty in epidemiologic findings, both to other scientists (e.g., in peer-reviewed papers) and to the public or to other stakeholders. The chapter by Savitz and Wellenius provides some high-level guidance and advice to epidemiologists about their duties to describe evidence in a dispassionate way, but also to make good faith efforts to distill findings in ways suitably tailored for different audiences. Some additional discussion of how to consider biases across different studies when synthesizing evidence is also included. The piece by Blastland et al. is more direct in providing advice to scientists on how to communicate about evidence, largely arguing that our duties are to be transparent in reporting, especially about uncertainty, rather than attempting to persuade or change opinions.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-03-31: How much does “evidence” even matter?\n\nWhat:\n\nGreenhalgh T. Miasmas, Mental Models and Preventive Public Health: Some Philosophical Reflections on Science in the COVID-19 Pandemic. Interface Focus 2021;11: 1-8. [link] [7602 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nGreenhalgh uses the twin examples of the 19th century cholera epidemics in England and the present pandemic to talk about the role of ‘extra-scientific’ values in shaping how we view and decide on what kind of ‘evidence’ is compelling, and ties this to current (and ongoing) debates regarding the use of evidence in the COVID-19 pandemic."

This creates a kind of cultural inertia in science that has produced important advances, but also creates problems. Can we change the culture to improve the way epidemiology is working today? This last session asks you to consider this question.\n\nWhat:\n\nMathur MB, Fox MP. Toward open and reproducible epidemiology. Am J Epidemiol (forthcoming) [link] [5823 words]\nLakens D. Is my study useless? Why researchers need methodological review boards. Nature 2023;613(7942):9–9. [link] [977 words]\n\n\n\nWhy:\nThese two papers aim to argue for adopting larger scale innovations in social sciences (including epidemiology). Mathur and Fox make a strong case for greater openness and transparency, specifically in epidemiology. Lakens (a psychologist) makes a case that ethical review boards have an obligation to consider whether proposed research is capable of producing reliable evidence, and suggests they should have the power to intervene to stop work that has a low probability of providing reliable evidence.\n\n\n\nFriday 2023-04-07: No class (Good Friday)"

The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer’s disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States."

We sought to determine if fetuses with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids had increased rates of prescriptions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication in childhood, using a quasiexperimental design that better controls for confounding than existing observational studies. Methods: We identified 16 358 children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery between 31 + 0 (31 weeks, 0 days) and 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation in 2000–2013, using a perinatal data registry from British Columbia, Canada, and linked their records with population-based child ADHD medication data (2000–2018). We used a regression discontinuity design to capitalize on the fact that pregnancies presenting for delivery immediately before and immediately after the clinical cut-off for antenatal corticosteroid administration of 34 + 0 weeks’ gestation have very different levels of exposure to corticosteroids, but are otherwise similar with respect to confounders. Results: Over a median follow-up period of 9 years, 892 (5.5%) children had 1 or more dispensations of ADHD medication. Children whose birthing parents were admitted for delivery just before the corticosteroid clinical cut-off of 34 + 0 weeks’ gestation did not appear to be more likely to be prescribed ADHD medication than those admitted just after the cut-off (rate ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 1.6; 1.3 excess cases per 100 children, 95% CI −2.5 to 5.7). Interpretation: We found little evidence that children with higher probability of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids have higher rates of ADHD prescriptions in childhood, supporting the safety of antenatal corticosteroids for this neurodevelopmental outcome."

DOI: 10.1002/wps.21278 Citations:\n \n  \n\n View\n\n\nAbstract:\nMental disorders are associated with elevated mortality rates and reduced life expectancy. However, it is unclear whether these associations differ by socioeconomic position (SEP). The aim of this study was to explore comprehensively the role of individual-level SEP in the associations between specific types of mental disorders and mortality (due to all causes, and to natural or external causes), presenting both relative and absolute measures. This was a cohort study including all residents in Denmark on January 1, 2000, following them up until December 31, 2020. Information on mental disorders, SEP (income percentile, categorized into low, {\\(&lt;\\)}20%; medium, 20-79%; and high, ≥80%), and mortality was obtained from nationwide registers. We computed the average reduction in life expectancy for those with mental disorders, relative and absolute differences in mortality rates, and proportional attributable fractions. Subgroup analyses by sex and age groups were performed. Overall, 5,316,626 individuals (2,689,749 females and 2,626,877 males) were followed up for 95.2 million person-years. People with mental disorders had a shorter average life expectancy than the general population regardless of SEP (70.9-77.0 vs. 77.2-85.1 years, depending on income percentile). Among individuals with a mental disorder, the subgroup in the top 3% of the income distribution had the longest average life expectancy (77.0 years), and this estimate was lower than the shortest life expectancy in the general Danish population (77.2 years for individuals in the bottom 6% income distribution). The mortality rate differences were larger in the low-income than the high-income group (19.6 vs. 13.3 per 1,000 person-years). For natural causes of death, a socioeconomic gradient for differences in life expectancy and mortality rates was observed across most diagnoses, both sexes, and all age groups. For external causes, no such gradient was observed. In the low-SEP group, 10.1% of all deaths and 23.7% of those related to external causes were attributable to mental disorders, compared with 3.5% and 8.7% in the high-SEP group. Thus, our data indicate that people with mental disorders have a shorter life expectancy even than people with the lowest SEP in the general population. The socioeconomic gradients in mortality rates due to natural causes highlight a greater need for coordinated care of physical diseases in people with mental disorders and low SEP."

However, there is currently little evidence on this question. Our objective was to estimate the effect of childhood vaccination on learning achievements among primary school children in India. Methods We used cohort data from the India Human Development Survey. Vaccination status and confounders were measured among children who were at least 12 months old at baseline in 2004–2005. In 2011–2012, the same children completed basic reading, writing and math tests. We estimated the effect of full vaccination during childhood on learning achievements using inverse probability of treatment-weighted logistic regression models and results reported on the risk difference scale. The propensity score included 33 potential community-, household-, mother- and child-level confounders as well as state fixed effects. Results Among the 4877 children included in our analysis, 54% were fully vaccinated at baseline, and 54% could read by the age of 8–11 years. The estimated effect of full vaccination on learning achievements ranged from 4 to 6 percentage points, representing relative increases ranging from 6% to 12%. Bias analysis suggested that our observed effects could be explained by unmeasured confounding, but only in the case of strong associations with the treatment and outcome. Conclusion These results support the hypothesis that vaccination has lasting effects on children’s learning achievements. Further work is needed to confirm findings and elucidate the potential mechanisms linking vaccines to educational outcomes."

As part of a baseline assessment of the program, this study investigated variability in personal air pollution exposures within villages and between villages and evaluated exposure patterns by sociodemographic factors. We randomly recruited 446 participants in 50 villages in four districts in rural Beijing and measured 24 h personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). The geometric mean personal exposure to PM2.5 and BC was 72 and 2.5 μg/m3, respectively. The variability in PM2.5 and BC exposures was greater within villages than between villages. Study participants who used traditional stoves as their dominant source of space heating were exposed to the highest levels of PM2.5 and BC. Wealthier households tended to burn more coal for space heating, whereas less wealthy households used more biomass. PM2.5 and BC exposures were almost uniformly distributed by socioeconomic status. Future work that combines these results with PM2.5 chemical composition analysis will shed light on whether air pollution source contributors (e.g., industrial, traffic, and household solid fuel burning) follow similar distributions."

Few studies have assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on community and indoor air quality in environments with diverse socioeconomic and household energy use patterns. The main goal of this study was to evaluate whether indoor and community air pollution differed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in homes with different energy use patterns. Using calibrated real-time PM2.5 sensors, we measured indoor and community air quality in 147 homes from 30 villages in Beijing over 4 months including periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Community pollution was higher during the lockdown (61 ± 47 μg/m3) compared with before (45 ± 35 μg/m3, p {\\(&lt;\\)} 0.001) and after (47 ± 37 μg/m3, p {\\(&lt;\\)} 0.001) the lockdown. However, we did not observe significantly increased indoor PM2.5 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Indoor-generated PM2.5 in homes using clean energy for heating without smokers was the lowest compared with those using solid fuel with/without smokers, implying air pollutant emissions are reduced in homes using clean energy. Indoor air quality may not have been impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown in rural settings in China and appeared to be more impacted by the household energy choice and indoor smoking than the COVID-19 lockdown. As clean energy transitions occurred in rural households in northern China, our work highlights the importance of understanding multiple possible indoor sources to interpret the impacts of interventions, intended or otherwise."

Overall, there seems to be little support for the idea that income inequality is a major, generalizable determinant of population health differences within or between rich countries. Income inequality may, however, directly influence some health outcomes, such as homicide in some contexts. The strongest evidence for direct health effects is among states in the United States, but even that is somewhat mixed. Despite little support for a direct effect of income inequality on health per se, reducing income inequality by raising the incomes of the most disadvantaged will improve their health, help reduce health inequalities, and generally improve population health."

The distinctive physical, social, and cultural attributes of rural areas can exacerbate many of the challenges of childhood poverty. Yet rural children have better access to public childcare services and perform as well as urban children on standardized tests. Life trajectories diverge most sharply when rural youths decide whether to leave their home communities. Those who stay typically face limited opportunities for higher education and well-paid, stable employment, whereas those who leave fare remarkably well with respect to their educational, economic, and health outcomes. In sum, growing up in rural America offers distinctive advantages and disadvantages, yet the benefits may accrue primarily to those who leave."

Study design, measurement and analytical decisions made by researchers are a function of their social systems, academic training, values and biases, which influence both the findings and interpretation of whether inequalities or inequities exist. Methodological choices can lead to results with different implications for research and policy priorities, including where supplementary programmes and services are offered and for whom. The objective of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the methods, including study design, measures and statistical approaches, used in quantitative and qualitative observational studies of health equity in end-of-life cancer care, and to consider how these methods align with recommended approaches for studying health equity questions. Methods and analysis This scoping review follows Arksey and O’Malley’s expanded framework for scoping reviews. We will systematically search Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO electronic databases for quantitative and qualitative studies that examined equity stratifiers in relation to end-of-life cancer care and/or outcomes published in English or French between 2010 and 2021. Two authors will independently review all titles, abstracts and full texts to determine which studies meet the inclusion criteria. Data from included full-text articles will be extracted into a data form that will be developed and piloted by the research team. Extracted information will be summarised quantitatively and qualitatively. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is required for this scoping review. Results will be disseminated to researchers examining questions of health equity in cancer care through scientific publication and presentation at relevant conferences."

Components included training healthcare providers and community health workers, infrastructure upgrades, and improvements to health management. This study aimed to examine the impact of trainings on four key outcomes: skilled birth attendance, antenatal care, respectful maternity care and patient–provider communication. Methods Trainings were delivered sequentially at four time points between 2018 and 2019 in eight districts (two districts at a time). Cross-sectional surveys were administered to a random sample of households in all districts at baseline and after each training wave. Due to practical necessities, the original stepped wedge cluster randomised design of the evaluation was altered mid-programme. Therefore, a difference-in-differences for multiple groups in multiple periods was adopted to compare outcomes in treated districts to not yet treated districts. Risk differences were estimated for the overall average treatment effect on the treated and group/time dynamic effects. Results Respondents reported 3895 deliveries over the course of the study. The intervention was associated with a 12.9 percentage point increase in skilled birth attendance (95% CI 0.4 to 25.4), which began to increase 4 months after the end of training in each district. There was little evidence of impact on antenatal care visits, respectful treatment during delivery and patient–provider communication. Conclusion Interventions to train local healthcare workers in basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care increased skilled birth attendance but had limited impact on other pregnancy-related outcomes."

    "text": "Background\nLast fall Adam Palayew and I wrote about an interesting paper that claimed that the number of people in fatal traffic crashes increased by 12% on April the 20th. For those that don’t know, April 20th (or ‘420’) is a day of celebration of all things cannabis, with large outdoor gatherings where cannabis consumption is promoted, especially at 4:20pm. The idea behind the paper was that excess consumption of cannabis on April 20th led to more drugged driving, and therefore more fatal accidents.\nIt’s an interesting and perhaps not implausible idea but, as always, the devil is in the details. The authors, John Staples and Donald Redelmeier used data from the Fatal Accident Accident Reporting System (FARS) and compared drivers involved in fatal accidents on 420 to those involved in accidents one week before and after for the period 1992-2016. This is an interesting design because it inherently compares fatal accidents on the same day of the week, and there is a lot of daily variation in fatal crashes (weekends are particularly deadly).\nThey reported that the number of drivers involved in fatal accidents was 12% higher on 420 compared to control days. This paper made quite a splash in the media, and was the 8th most talked about article for JAMA Internal Medicine in all of 2018:  \nOf course it also was widely discussed on social media and twitter, for example:\n\n\n;document.getElementById(\"tweet-39890\").innerHTML = tweet[\"html\"];\nAnd the authors also made some pretty strong claims in a press release:\n\n“Assuming fewer than 10 per cent of Americans drive while high on April 20, our results suggest that drug use at 420 celebrations more than doubles the risk of a fatal crash.”\n\n\n-Donald Redelmeier, February 12, 2018\n\nThis is a serious claim, though one might argue that the use of the relative term “doubling” doesn’t help to quantify how serious the problem might be in the absence of base rates. However, at a time of both liberalization of legislation for recreational marijuana and concern about the impacts of drugged driving, such claims naturally prompted other to look more carefully at the evidence.\nJayson Aydelotte and colleages wrote a letter to the editor at JAMA Internal Medicine specifically interrogating both the validity of considering two days a week before and after as control conditions, and, since 420 has been gaining in popularity, whether any impact might have increased over time.\n\nDisaggregating the control dates provided additional insights. When comparing the number of crashes for each study date over the study period, in some years the number of crashes on April 20 was quite similar to the number of crashes occurring on at least 1 of the control dates. The April 20 crash rate remained significantly higher than the April 13 crash rate (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.23) but was not significantly different from the April 27 crash rate (IRR, 1.09; 95%CI, 0.99-1.20).\n\nI’ll leave aside the continued focus on arbitrarily dividing the results into “significant” and “not significant”, which is not helpful, but they argue that April 13 and April 27 do not appear to be ‘equivalent’ control days (let’s be honest, however, that the intervals 1.02-1.23 and 0.99-1.20 are in no way substantively different). They also found weaker effects in more recent years, which is again perhaps at odds with what one would expect if 420 has become more popular."

    "text": "Update\nAdam and I also did our own analysis, which has now been published in the journal Injury Prevention, and we were able to replicate the findings of Staples and Redelmeier, but we also ran some additional sensitivity analyses and tried to put the findings in context of what we already know about “risky” driving days. A few key findings emerged from the paper, and I’ll just post a few figures from the paper to try and make the case.\n\nControl days and uncertainty\nFirst, there is a somewhat arcane technical issue related to how to calculate uncertainty around the estimated increase in fatal accidents that happen on 420 relative to “control” days. Sadly, this is relevant because many prominent journals (including leading medical journals) use filters related to “statistical significance” as a way to highlight “novel” findings. In practice, that means it’s interesting only if p &lt; 0.05,1 and it is perhaps no surprise that the 420 paper found that, “The risk of a fatal crash was significantly higher on April 20 (relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19; P = .001).”\nWe investigated this by: a) looking at alternative ways of estimating uncertainty; b) adding control days two weeks before/after the index date of 420 or using all other days as the control period; and c) comparing 420 to July 4th (previously shown to demonstrate excess deaths). Here is a figure showing the comparison between 420 and July 4th (left and right panels, respectively), and for different control periods (upper and lower panels, respectively):\n\n\n\nheader\n\n\nThe thing to notice here is the greater uncertainty that is evident when one takes a more robust approach to estimating the variance, which may have tipped the paper into the p &gt;0.05 of what Edward Tufte used to call the “zone of boredom, ambiguity, and unpublishability”. But you can also see that expanding the control period to 2 weeks (or the rest of the year) diminshes any impact of 420, but not July 4th, which appears very reliably associated with excess deaths.\n\n\nCompared to what?\nSecond, we also tried to look at how the “excess risk” on 420 compares with similar risks on all other days of the year. We basically just ran the same simple negative binomial regression for each day using 2 control days a week apart for each day of the year. The graph below shows the results on the (log) rate ratio scale:\n\n\n\nheader\n\n\nYou can see from the figure above that the excess risk on 420 does not seem readily distinguishable from daily variations across the entire year. Some clear risky days stand out (July 4th, for example), but if one applies the same filter as the 420 paper and just looks for days when there are “significant” relative excesses (or deficits) of fatal crashes,2 there are actually a lot of days that need explaining:\n\n\n\nheader\n\n\nI wonder if one just picked random years whether any of these days would be reliably associated with excess deaths? I would gather July 4th but, as it stands, it is hard to find plausible explanations for why some of these days stand out.\n\n\nTransient or persistent?\nFinally, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model and partial pooling across years to evaluate whether any impact of 420 changed over time (this was also partially addressed by the letter from Aydelotte et al.). The plots below show results from models where we allowed the impact of certain “key” dates well-known to be associated with excess fatal crashes (July 4th, Labor Day weekend) to vary over time. Since 420 is a recent phenomenon we wondered whether we could see changes over time (increases?) in excess deaths. What does seem clear is that there is no reliable excess of drivers involved in fatal crashes on 420, but very clear excesses (and deficits) on other days. This speaks to whether one might just argue that the data are too noisy to detect any reliable signal.\n\n\n\nheader\n\n\nA couple of final points. As we mentioned in the other post, there are also important questions about whether, practically speaking, it is plausible that drugged driving on 420 would be serious enough to raise the population-wide rate of fatal accidents by something like 12%. It’s hard to believe, and our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggested that around 15% of the population would need to be driving while high on 420 from 4:20pm to midnight to generate the kinds of excess rates seen in the Staples/Redelmeier paper.\nAnd I should also say that this paper was not an attack on the original work by Staples and Redelmeier. I will cop to seeing the paper and being skeptical about the results, but through the process of trying to reproduce their results, we started to think about new questions that could be asked of the data, what kinds of methods might be necessary to answer a question like this, and in general I think this ended up being a really interesting process of discovery. I should also say that because we decided to make all of the data and code available when we submitted the paper (which was first rejected by the Canadian Medical Association Journal), the review process at Injury Prevention was really productive:\n\n\n;document.getElementById(\"tweet-83610\").innerHTML = tweet[\"html\"];"

Missing the Trees for the Forest\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, life expectancy in the United States has stagnated, followed by three consecutive years of decline. The decline is small in absolute terms but is unprecedented and has generated considerable research interest and theorizing about potential causes. Recent trends show that the decline has affected nearly all race/ethnic and gender groups, and the proximate causes of the decline are increases in opioid overdose deaths, suicide, homicide, and Alzheimer’s disease. A slowdown in the long-term decline in mortality from cardiovascular diseases has also prevented life expectancy from improving further. Although a popular explanation for the decline is the cumulative decline in living standards across generations, recent trends suggest that distinct mechanisms for specific causes of death are more plausible explanations. Interventions to stem the increase in overdose deaths, reduce access to mechanisms that contribute to violent deaths, and decrease cardiovascular risk over the life course are urgently needed to improve mortality in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nApr 1, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "[Note: this post was written with Adam Palayew]\nThis Friday is April 20th, a day that for most people means nothing. Americans are relieved at having filed their taxes, Canadians are stressed in anticipation of filing theirs, and in Montreal we are still wondering if winter will ever end. However, for a small minority of people, April 20th (or 4/20) is a day of celebration of all things cannabis, with large outdoor gatherings where cannabis consumption is promoted, especially at 4:20pm.\nBig deal, right? Let ’em have fun. However, a few weeks ago a short paper was published in a leading medical journal, JAMA Internal Medicine, suggesting that, over the 25 years from 1992-2016, excess cannabis consumption after 4:20pm on 4/20 increased fatal traffic crashes by 12% relative to fatal crashes that occurred one week before and one week after. Here is the key result from the paper:\nNaturally, this sparked (heh) considerable media interest, not only because p&lt;.05 and the finding is “surprising”, but also because cannabis is a hot topic these days (and, of course, April 20th happens every year).\nHere in Canada, recreational cannabis is going to be legal throughout the nation later this summer, and the movement to make recreational cannabis legal continues to gather strength in the US. Moreover, the topic of impaired driving due to cannabis consumption has also seen increased attention in recent years. And, of course, using the relative scale to measure the impact also helps to make a splash. Here is a quote from the University of British Columbia’s press release:"

    "section": "How seriously should we take these findings?",
    "text": "How seriously should we take these findings?\nWe should say at the beginning, this is an interesting idea and some aspects of the study design are clever and thoughtful. In particular, comparing fatal crashes on 4/20 after 4:20pm to “control” days at the same time of day one week before and after inherently adjusts for seasonal and day-of-the-week factors, changes in vehicle design, as well as obviating the need for a denominator, assuming that the population-at-risk and/or vehicle traffic volume is likely to be similar a week apart from 4/20.\nHowever, there are, we think, some reasons to be skeptical about the plausibility of the findings, as well as some methodological problems to sort out before we decide to start intervening to prevent these excess deaths (it goes without saying that we think driving while intoxicated with any substance that impairs your faculties is a bad idea).\nIn order for 4/20 celebrations to raise the national number of fatal crashes by 12%, it has to either lead to considerably increased consumption or increases in particularly risky kinds of driving relative to control days. The authors argue for the former, noting that 4/20 is associated with “synchronized mass consumption.” So, is 4/20 popular enough to lead to a meaningful increase in the proportion of people driving-while-high?\nThe authors defined 4/20 celebrations as having started in 1992, claiming that 4/20 events were popularized as a consequence of High Times magazine publishing a 1991 editorial declaring, “the grandmaster of all holidays: 4/20, or April 20th” (see timeline below). However, there is evidence that the first 4/20 celebration in the US did not occur until 1997 and was limited to Hippie Hill San Francisco with a few thousand people in attendance (some interesting history here, here, and here). The large 4/20 celebrations seen more recently (e.g., the last 5 years) are likely due to a combination of legalization of recreational use in certain areas (Colorado, Washington, etc.), wider societal acceptance, and the growth of the cannabis market into a lucrative industry.\n\n\n\nTimeline of the evolution of 4/20.\n\n\nInterestingly, Staples and Redelmeier also show state variations in the impact of 4/20, but the heterogeneity is a little puzzling. Not all states celebrate 4/20 with the same enthusiasm (we are still trying estimate potential size of celebrations), and states that you would expect to have elevated rates if 4/20 causes excess crashes are not the ones highlighted in Figure 2 of their paper (Hawaii, Minnesota, Maine). The largest and most popular 4/20 celebrations have typically been in California and Colorado, but the analysis by SR found that both California and Colorado were states with a lower than median 4/20 risk (or perhaps there are fewer ‘newbies’ smoking there or folks are more accustomed to driving while high or know their limits better)."

    "text": "Is it plausible?\nIf we try and back out some estimates of what might have to happen on 4/20 to generate a 12% increase in the national rate of fatal car crashes, it seems less and less plausible that the 4/20 effect is reliable or valid. Let’s give it a shot.\nIn 2015 there were 17,466 driver deaths, so on any given day there are an average of about 48 driver deaths. With respect to person-time at risk, in 2015 there were 3,095 billion (yes, billion) vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Not all of those miles are accrued by drivers, but the 2009 National Household Travel Survey estimated 30 daily VMT per driver and 212 million drivers, which gives use roughly 6.4 billion daily VMT by drivers. So let’s say the base rate is around 48 deaths / 6,400,000,000 VMT per day = 0.0000000075 deaths per VMT, or 7.5 deaths per billion VMT. The transportation survey also suggests that about 1/3 of VMT occur between 4pm and midnight, so let’s also say that during those hours (the time of day SR restrict to) there are roughly 2.5 billion VMT each day.\nOver the 25 year period SR tally 1369 deaths on 4/20 and 2453 deaths on control days, which works out to average deaths on those days each year of 1369/25 ~ 55 on 4/20 and 2453/25/2 ~ 49 on control days, an average excess of about 6 deaths each year. If we use our estimates of post-1620h VMT above, that works out to around 55/2.5 = 22 fatal crashes per billion VMT on 4/20 vs. 49/2.5 = 19.6 on control days.\nNow, on any given day the fatal crash rate in the whole population can be expressed as a weighted average of the fatal crash rates for non-cannabis-intoxicated drivers and intoxicated cannabis drivers:\n\\[Rate_{population} = \\%(sober) \\times Rate_{sober} + \\%(stoned) \\times Rate_{stoned}\\]\nIn order to estimate how the excess deaths are generated, we need to know what fraction of the population is driving while high, and what their risk might be relative to non-cannabis users.\nBoth American and Canadian reports suggest a similar prevalence of past-year cannabis use among adults (~12%), but it isn’t clear whether these kinds of casual users are likely to be 4/20 celebrants. Past month use in the US is closer to 8%, and daily use (we’d say more folks likely to be 4/20 celebrants) is more like 2.5%.\nWhat about driving high? Roadside tests in Canada indicate 4-6% of drivers reported having used cannabis, as well as 20% of the 12% of cannabis users admitting to driving within 2 hours of cannabis use (.20*.12 = 0.024) [see the report by Capler et al.]. If we conservatively say that 3% of the population is driving after using cannabis, what is their risk of a fatal crash? A meta-analysis published in BMJ says that acute cannabis use roughly doubles the risk of a fatal crash (but note enormous heterogeneity among studies contributing to that in that estimate). Let’s plug these numbers in and see what we get.\nOn control days for the sober rate let’s assume based on our estimates above a daily rate of 19 deaths per billion VMT during the hours from 4:20pm to midnight. Let’s also suppose that around 3% of the population are driving while high, and they have twice the fatal crash rate (38/bVMT) of the sober. This generates something similar to the base rate we calculated above (19.6 deaths per billion VMT):\nControl day rate: .97(19) + .03(38) = 19.6\nRecall that on 4/20 the rate increases by 12% to 22. If we don’t assume the relative risk changes on 4/20, just more people smoking, what proportion of the population would need to be driving while high to generate a rate of 22 per billion VMT? A little algebra tells us that to get to 22 we’d need to see something like:\n4/20 day rate: .85(19) + .15(38) = 21.9\n15%! That’s nearly one-sixth of the population driving while high on 4/20 from 4:20pm to midnight, which doesn’t, absent any other evidence, seem very likely. (Note that our base rates don’t really need to be correct here; even if the sober rate is 10 or 30/bVMT, you’d still need 15% driving-while-high on 4/20 to increase the rate by 12%). Alternatively, one could also raise the relative risk among cannabis drivers to 6x the base rate and get something close. Or some combination of the two. This means either the nationwide prevalence of driving while using cannabis increases massively on 4/20, or the RR of a fatal crash with the kind of cannabis use happening on 4/20 is absurdly high. Neither of these scenarios seem particularly likely based on what we currently know about cannabis use and driving risks.\nNow, of course we are just making guesses, and it’s true that we don’t have much strong evidence for saying that 15% of drivers nationwide being impaired after 4:20pm on 4/20 is an implausibly high estimate, but neither do Staples and Redelmeier present any evidence that it is reasonably plausible (Redelmeier said less than 10% in the quote above)."

    "text": "Extra-Poisson variation (yes, that).\nEven if we accept the plausibility of a meaningful point estimate of the effect of 4/20 on fatal crashes, we have other issues to deal with. Namely, other sources of variation in an outcome like daily traffic crashes that are ignored by SR, who effectively treat each year as a matched pair of case and control days but fail to account for this matching when calculating their measure of precision (remember that p&lt;.05).\nBetween 1992 and 2016 they report 1369 deaths on 4/20 and 2453 deaths on the combined days of 4/13 and 4/27. One can easily reproduce their estimate and measure of precision (RR=1.12, 95%CI 1.04, 1.19) with the basic assumption that there is twice as much unexposed person-time during the “control” days:\n\n\n\nSimple tabular replication in Stata.\n\n\nTurning to regression models, one could use Poisson regression to model the effect of 4/20 relative to control days on the daily count of deaths, but Poisson regression assumes that the mean and variance of the outcome variable are equal. If there is “extra-Poisson” variation, the data exhibit overdispersion. What is that? We aren’t biostatisticians, so here is a description from the late Joseph Hilbe, who wrote a lovely book on this kind of regression analysis:\n\nOverdispersion is caused by positive correlation between responses or by an excess variation between response probabilities or counts.   Overdispersion also arises when there are violations in the distributional assumptions of the data, such as when the data are clustered and thereby violate the likelihood independence of observations assumption.   Overdispersion may cause standard errors of the estimates to be deflated or underestimated.   -Joseph Hilbe, Negative Binomial Regresson (2nd ed.), p.141.\n\nThese issues (overdispersion, clustering) are relevant to the 4/20 problem, so we used the same Fatal Analysis Reporting System (FARS) dataset (restricted to drivers and the same time of day) to see whether accounting for additional variation in daily traffic crashes would provide alternative estimates of precision. Not surprisingly, it does. First, it’s easy to show that the tabular estimate is identical to what you get using Poisson regression (beta=0.11, se=0.034, IRR=1.12, 95%CI 1.05, 1.19). Then one can correct for overdispersion and/or extra-Poisson variation a few different ways:\nuse negative binomial regression; scale the standard errors by the Pearson-based dispersion statistic; use a robust clustered variance (year as cluster). We also included a model using a resampling technique (bootstrapping with 500 replications) as another possible way to estimate the standard error. Here are the results:\n\n\n\nSource: Authors’ analysis of FARS data (n=75 for each model, i.e., deaths on 1 case and 2 control days x 25 years from 1992-2016.)\n\n\nAs can be seen in the table above, any of these techniques would have yielded a larger standard error and, obviously, p&gt;.05. We aren’t saying JAMA Int Med wouldn’t have considered it, but there are (sadly), good reasons to think so.\nBut why consider 4/20 in isolation? Is it especially different from other days of the year? We ran the same analysis (using negative binomial regression) for every day of the year (comparing deaths between 1620h and 2359h on each day relative to the days one week before and after), and here is a plot of the results for each day:\n\n\n\nSource: Authors’ analysis of FARS data (n=75 for each estimate, i.e., 1 case and 2 control days a week before and after x 25 years from 1992-2016.)\n\n\nThere is quite a lot of noise in these daily crash rate ratios, and few that appear reliably above or below the rates +/- one week. Although accounting for overdispersion leads to estimates for 4/20 that are not statistically distinguishable from the null (a distinction that we don’t think is meaningful), apparently there are several other days to worry about (excess deaths) and/or celebrate (reduced deaths):\n\nRather than 4/20, should we be concerned about May 25? (out-of-control Geek Pride Day celebrations?) What about July 14? (Americans celebrating Bastille Day?) December 18?\nBut the table and graph above also suggest it’s not all noise. The elevated rates of fatal crashes around Labor Day and July 4th have been noted many times. So it’s also instructive to compare 4/20 to July the 4th. Here are crude incidence rate-ratios for each year, across the entire range of the FARS data (back to 1975).\nFirst for 4/20:\n\n\n\nSource: Authors’ analysis of FARS data. IRR and 95%CI computed with Stata’s -iri command.\n\n\nSame analyses for July 4th:\n\n\n\nSource: Authors’ analysis of FARS data. IRR and 95%CI computed with Stata’s -iri command.\n\n\nNote the more consistently elevated estimates for 7/04 vs. 4/20 in each year. Again, it is difficult to see much signal in the 4/20 estimates, and clearly there is a fair bit of noise in both sets of estimates. It would probably be beneficial to study these problems using hierarchical or Bayesian models, as has been suggested for similar analyses of “day” effect problems."

    "text": "Concluding thoughts\nTaken together, we think the preceding discussion of plausibility and methodological concerns should temper any conclusions regarding 4/20 and fatal traffic crashes. We should also point out that this post is not meant as a “take down” or critique of Staples and Redelmeier as researchers. Rather, SR have identified an interesting question and we hoped to provide some additional exploration, context and considerations that were not able to make it into their report. We are writing a more formal paper exploring some of these issues and will post all of the data and code for that analysis, as we have for other papers. We remain skeptical that the impact of 4/20 is as large as SR claim, but are open to seeing other evidence to change our minds.\nSo, this 4/20, we hope everyone celebrating does so with enthusiasm, but appropriate caution.

    "text": "Image credit: XKCD\n\n\nThis week I saw an interesting paper published by NBER by D. Mark Anderson, Kyutaro Matsuzawa, and Joseph J. Sabia (an ungated version is posted on Anderson’s website) about the impact of marriage equality laws on youth suicide risk.\nObviously, this paper is interesting on it’s own: Marriage equality laws may have plausible impacts on mental health, especially among marginalized populations. Anderson et al. also argue that there could be some potential negative consequences for mental health due to political backlash.

    "text": "II.\nNext, they try and replicate several of the findings of Raifman et al. (2017). I won’t digress too much here, except to say that it may come as little surprise to anyone that JAMA Pediatrics does not require (or ask) authors to post either datasets or code that would help to facilitate straightforward computational replication. However, the data are public and the design is relatively straightforward, and Raifman et al. were pretty clear about what they did.\nHere is what Anderson et al. found when they tried to replicate the main findings:\n\nIn column (1) of Table 3, we attempt to replicate the original findings of Raifman et al. (2017). Following Raifman et al. (2017), we estimate equation (1), adjusting standard errors for clustering at the state-by-grade level and weighting regressions using the State YRBS-provided sampling weights. As discussed above, clustering at the state-by-grade level may lead to standard errors that are too small and the State YRBS weights are not designed to be comparable across states or even within states over time. Based on this specification, we find that SSM laws are associated with a 0.66 percentage point decrease in suicide attempts among U.S. high school students. This estimate is statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5 percent level and is nearly identical to the estimate reported in Raifman et al. (2017).\n\nNearly identical estimates seems pretty great, and of course this really helps Anderson et al. make their case for how other kinds of choices may have impacted the Raifman et al. results.\nNow here is the part that got me going:\n\nIn column (2), we correct the standard errors by adjusting them for clustering them at the level of policy variation (i.e., the state). This adjustment results in a 56 percent increase in the estimated standard error, rendering the estimate statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional levels.\n\nSo, they find that the standard errors are sensitive to whether they are clustered at the state vs. the state-grade level. In terms of point estimates and 95% confidence intervals, here are those estimates from Anderson et al.:\n\n\n\nLevel of clustering\nEstimate (percentage points)\n95%CI\n\n\n\n\nState, grade\n-0.66\n-1.2, -0.1\n\n\nState\n-0.66\n-1.5, 0.2\n\n\n\nNow, there is, of course, a larger discussion to be had about how we should feel about the difference between those two estimates. Anderson et al. focus on the new results being “statistically indistiguishingable” from the zero. If one wanted to, one could obtain the analogous p-values for these estimates, and I’m sure readers won’t be surprised where that would lead. But the larger point is that dealing with clustering for group-level treatments is important and there has been a lot of discussion about it (the title of this post is a riff on a series of blog posts by the economist Chris Blattman and others discussing the issue of clustered standard errors).\nThe other issue I’ll discuss is heterogenous effects by sexual minority status. Raifman et al. (2017) reported that the impact of laws in reducing suicide attempts was stronger among sexual minorities (their estimate was -4.0 with a 95%CI of -6.9 to -1.2). However, as Anderson et al. point out, their model only forces all covariates (including state and year fixed effects) to be identical for sexual minorities and heterosexuals. They allow these to differ by using a fully interacted model and compare:\n\n\n\nModel\nEstimate\n95%CI\n\n\n\n\nSexual minorities (partially interacted)\n-4.2\n-6.7, -1.6\n\n\nSexual minorities (fully interacted)\n-1.6\n-4.9, 1.7\n\n\n\nAgain, the first estimates are nearly identical to Raifman et al. (2017), but this model choice has serious consequences and reduces the impact among this subpopulation, as Anderson et al. note:\n\nIn panel II of Table 4, we restrict the sample to sexual minorities, allowing the effects of the covariates to differ for this subgroup. In this case, the absolute magnitude of the estimated policy impact falls by 67 percent; we consistently find that SSM laws are associated with a statistically insignificant 1.4 to 1.5 percentage-point reduction in suicide attempts. In panel III, we find no evidence that SSM laws affect suicide attempts among self-identified heterosexuals, and estimates from fully-interacted DDD models (panel IV) are in line with those shown in panel II, suggesting that forcing coefficients on covariates to be equal for sexual minorities and heterosexuals may not be appropriate."

    "text": "III.\nOkay, so why am I going on at such length about these issues? Without trying to sound petulant (and vain), it’s because I brought up both of these issues when I first reviewed the paper for JAMA Pediatrics in October of 2016, yet obviously neither the authors nor the editor gave these comments much consideration.\nAt the risk of revealing parts of my review and, in retrospect, things I wish I might have said differently (or not at all), I’ll just highlight a couple of points I made in my review. First, on the issue of covariate differences in the “partially interacted” DD model, I said:\n\n\nI think the DDD idea is what the authors are getting at with this: “In the analysis focused on sexual minority youth, we estimated the interaction between state same-sex marriage and sexual minority identity and included binary control indicators for state same-sex marriage and for sexual minority identity.” but this statement is not clear to me. Including the product term between minority status and the treatment variable goes further toward the DDD type estimation, but (as far as I can tell, and since they are not mentioned in Table S2) does not account for state fixed differences in the minority-majority gap in suicide attempts (which could differ by treatment status), or for the fact that there may different secular trends for the minority and majority groups that are common to all states. These can be remedied by including product terms between the state fixed effects and minority status, and the year fixed effects and minority status.\n\n\nI did not go all the way and ask for separate models, but this is effectively the same issue regarding the DDD specification that Anderson et al. are worried about. Just including a product term in a “traditional” DD model between the DD coefficient and a group indicator makes strong assumptions about the fixed effects that may not be justified.\nSimilarly, on the issue of clustering:\n\n\nMore importantly, do the Taylor series standard errors adjust for clustering and potential serial correlation by state? I think they do, but this is an important issue in DD analysis (see the Bertrand paper already cited). I see now in the footnote to Table 2 that SEs were clustered “school and by classroom.” Cameron and Miller (J Hum Res 2015) discuss this situation in particular: “At the minimum, one should cluster at the level of the primary sampling unit though often there is reason to cluster at a broader level, such as clustering on state if regressors and errors are correlated within state.” Because it seems very likely that in the YRBS data for suicide attempts errors are correlated within state and, at a minimum, the authors should also cluster standard errors at the state level in a sensitivity analysis, though my preference would be to do this for the main analysis.\n\n\nI regret saying “I think they do,” since I should know better, but also felt like I wanted to be positive and give the authors the benefit of the doubt. Regardless, I thought I made it clear that I did not think the standard errors were clustered at the right level, gave some rationale for why they should be worried about it, and asked that they do this for the main analysis, or at least as a sensitivity analysis. Apparently they did not find this compelling.\nEven more frustrating, when I looked at the email from the editor giving the “Revise and Resubmit”, I can now see that another reviewer made the same comment(!):\n\n\nClustering. Table 2 refers to clustering by school and classroom. But this is not described in the text. More importantly, I think the authors should show models with clustering at the state level instead of at these other levels. In general standard errors should be clustered at the level at which the treatment varies. Here, that level is state, not classroom or school. This may affect precision; results should be shown with various levels of clustering, similar to the robustness analyses currently shown.\n\n\nSo we have 2 reviewers (the only 2 reviewers, as far as I’m aware) both asking (with reasons) for the anlaysis to be done with SE clustered at the state level, yet what we end up with is a paper with SEs clustered at the “state and grade level”. Is this what we want from peer review? And for all you counterfactualists out there, what do you think would have happened to this paper at JAMA Pediatrics had the authors clustered the standard errors at the state level?"

    "text": "IV.\nThe purpose of this post isn’t to comment specifically about the substantive issues under investigation in these papers (obviously, that is important, too). And it certainly isn’t to throw stones at Raifman et al. (disclosure: I know one of the authors personally). I thought the paper had many positive qualities, but needed some additional work and robustness testing. Pretty standard for a lot of DD papers.\nMy concern is about how peer review is handled. We already have a huge problem with research waste in biomedical research, and having smart people like Anderson et al. spend lots of time correcting flaws in a paper that were previously identified during the “normal” process of peer review seems like a waste of time and resources. Why even bother with peer review at all? Had the first version of this paper been published without any peer review, my guess is that we would see much the same paper by Anderson et al. Yes, on one hand, I can see this as a great example of a well-designed replication paper. Anderson et al. found “much to admire” in Raifman et al. (2017), but also believed the results deserved to be further interrogated. Plus, they attempt to advance the evidence further by including more post-treatment data, taking advantage of a new potential source of exogenous variation, and looking at other outcomes. All good.\nOn the other hand, however, I’m frustrated that the process of peer review in the first go around could have been more transparent. Did the editor communicate to the authors the concerns that both reviewers had about the clustering issue? Perhaps the authors argued against clustering at the state level in their response, but why then did we end up with “state-grade” clustering? When I spend my time reviewing a paper I generally hope that both the authors and the editor take my comments seriously. But I don’t pretend that every comment I make in a review is equally important, or important at all. I can (and do) focus on pendantic, pet issues that bother me, but this is a case where the paper is about a serious policy (and health) issue, the authors are doing some non-standard-practice things and, as we seem to have learned from Anderson et al., these choices actually do make a difference to the results and interpretation.\nPerhaps it is my fault for not following up more closely. In fairness, I may have ticked the box when submitting my review that I didn’t want to see the paper again, having already invested a lot of time in reviewing it and providing what I thought were helpful comments. In fact, I tried to login to the JAMA Pediatrics site to retrieve my review and see how the paper was handled and perhaps whether I asked not to see it again, and not only is there no record of my review, they don’t even have me in the system as a peer reviewer!\n\nWhat the hell kind of clown show is going on here?!\nFinally, it’s also important to say that NBER papers are not peer-reviewed and I’m sure Anderson et al.’s paper will also benefit from the scrutiny of the peer review process. I just hope that the peer reviewers who use their limited time to provide this crucial activity, free-of-charge, have their reports faithfully considered by editors when making judgements about the paper’s merits."

DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004022 Citations:\n \n  \n\n View\n\n\nAbstract:\nBackground Starting in 2006 to 2007, the Government of Bangladesh implemented the Maternal Health Voucher Scheme (MHVS). This program provides pregnant women with vouchers that can be exchanged for health services from eligible public and private sector providers. In this study, we examined whether access to the MHVS was associated with maternal health services utilization, stillbirth, and neonatal and infant mortality. Methods and findings We used information on pregnancies and live births between 2000 to 2016 reported by women 15 to 49 years of age surveyed as part of the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys. Our analytic sample included 23,275 pregnancies lasting at least 7 months for analyses of stillbirth and between 15,125 and 21,668 live births for analyses of health services use, neonatal, and infant mortality. With respect to live births occurring prior to the introduction of the MHVS, 31.3%, 14.1%, and 18.0% of women, respectively, reported receiving at least 3 antenatal care visits, delivering in a health institution, and having a skilled birth attendant at delivery. Rates of neonatal and infant mortality during this period were 40 and 63 per 1,000 live births, respectively, and there were 32 stillbirths per 1,000 pregnancies lasting at least 7 months. We applied a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of providing subdistrict-level access to the MHVS program, with inverse probability of treatment weights to address selection into the program. The introduction of the MHVS program was associated with a lagged improvement in the probability of delivering in a health facility, one of the primary targets of the program, although associations with other health services were less evident. After 6 years of access to the MHVS, the probabilities of reporting at least 3 antenatal care visits, delivering in a health facility, and having a skilled birth attendant present increased by 3.0 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) = −4.8, 10.7], 6.5 (95% CI = −0.6, 13.6), and 5.8 (95% CI = −1.8, 13.3) percentage points, respectively. We did not observe evidence consistent with the program improving health outcomes, with probabilities of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, and infant mortality decreasing by 0.7 (95% CI = −1.3, 2.6), 0.8 (95% CI = −1.7, 3.4), and 1.3 (95% CI = −2.5, 5.1) percentage points, respectively, after 6 years of access to the MHVS. The sample size was insufficient to detect smaller associations with adequate precision. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of measurement error, although it was likely nondifferential by treatment group, or unmeasured confounding by concomitant interventions that were implemented differentially in treated and control areas. Conclusions In this study, we found that the introduction of the MHVS was positively associated with the probability of delivering in a health facility, but despite a longer period of follow-up than most extant evaluations, we did not observe attendant reductions in stillbirth, neonatal mortality, or infant mortality. Further work and engagement with stakeholders is needed to assess if the MHVS has affected the quality of care and health inequalities and whether the design and eligibility of the program should be modified to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes."

Between-individual SBP estimates were larger among participants with hypertension. There was no evidence of an effect of outdoor temperature on BP. Conclusion:~ Our results support previous findings of inverse associations between indoor temperature and BP but contrast with prior evidence of an inverse relationship with outdoor temperature. Wintertime home heating may be a population-wide intervention strategy for high BP and cardiovascular disease in China."

Bayesian analysis quantitatively incorporates prior knowledge, but is not often used in applied policy analysis. METHODS: We combined 2000-2016 data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System with priors based on past empirical studies and policy documents to study the impact of mandatory seat belt laws on traffic fatalities. We used a Bayesian data augmentation approach to combine information from prior studies with difference-in-differences analyses of recent law changes to provide updated evidence on the impact that upgrading to primary enforcement of seat belt laws has on fatalities. RESULTS: After incorporating the evidence from past studies, we find limited evidence to support the hypothesis that recent policy upgrades affect fatality rates. We estimate that upgrading to primary enforcement reduced fatality rates by 0.37 deaths per billion vehicle miles traveled (95% posterior interval -0.90, 0.16), or a rate ratio of 0.96 (95% posterior interval 0.91, 1.02), and increased the proportion of decedents reported as wearing seat belts by 7 percentage points (95% posterior interval 5, 8), or a risk ratio of 1.18 (95% posterior interval 1.13, 1.24).

The present study provides national estimates of income-related inequality in health care utilization and trends in the country over the past two decades.MethodsUsing data from the Paraguayan Permanent Household Survey, we estimated socioeconomic inequality in health care use during the period 1999–2018. We used poverty-to-income ratio as the socioeconomic stratifier and defined health care use as having reported a health problem and subsequent health care use in the last 90 days before interview. Inequality was summarized by rank- and level-based versions of the Concentration Index for binary outcomes.ResultsInequalities affecting those with lower incomes were present in all years assessed, although the magnitude of these inequalities declined over time. Inequality as expressed by the rank-based index decreased from 0.209 (95%CI 0.164; 0.253) in 1999 to 0.032 (95%CI -0.010; 0.075) in 2018. The level-based index decreased from 0.076 (95%CI -0.029; 0.182) in 1999 to 0.024 (0.002; 0.045) in 2018. Trends in both indices were generally stable from 1999 to 2009, with a noticeable decrease in 2010. The sharpest decreases relative to the 1999 baseline were observed in the period 2010–2018, reflecting changes in health care use and income distribution. Stratification by area, sex and older people suggest similar trends within subgroups.ConclusionsDecreases in inequality coincide temporally with increments in public health expenditure, removal of user fees in public health care facilities and the expansion of conditional cash-transfer programmes. Future research should disentangle the role of each of these policies in explaining the trends described."

Study design, measurement and analytical decisions made by researchers are a function of their social systems, academic training, values and biases, which influence both the findings and interpretation of whether inequalities or inequities exist. Methodological choices can lead to results with different implications for research and policy priorities, including where supplementary programmes and services are offered and for whom. The objective of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the methods, including study design, measures and statistical approaches, used in quantitative and qualitative observational studies of health equity in end-of-life cancer care, and to consider how these methods align with recommended approaches for studying health equity questions. Methods and analysis This scoping review follows Arksey and O’Malley’s expanded framework for scoping reviews. We will systematically search Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO electronic databases for quantitative and qualitative studies that examined equity stratifiers in relation to end-of-life cancer care and/or outcomes published in English or French between 2010 and 2021. Two authors will independently review all titles, abstracts and full texts to determine which studies meet the inclusion criteria. Data from included full-text articles will be extracted into a data form that will be developed and piloted by the research team. Extracted information will be summarised quantitatively and qualitatively. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is required for this scoping review. Results will be disseminated to researchers examining questions of health equity in cancer care through scientific publication and presentation at relevant conferences."

DOI: 10.1016/j.amepre.2022.07.012 Citations: 29\n \n  \n\n View Scholar\n\n\nAbstract:\nIntroduction There is substantial debate concerning the impact of cannabis decriminalization and legalization on road safety outcomes. Methods Seven databases were systematically searched: Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO through Ovid as well as Web of Science Core Collection, SafetyLit, Criminal Justice Database (ProQuest), and Transport Research International Documentation (from inception to June 16, 2021). Eligible primary studies examined group-level cannabis decriminalization or legalization and a road safety outcome in any population. Results A total of 65 reports of 64 observational studies were eligible, including 39 that applied a quasi-experimental design. Studies examined recreational cannabis legalization (n = 50), medical cannabis legalization (n = 22), and cannabis decriminalization (n = 5). All studies except 1 used data from the U.S. or Canada. Studies found mixed impacts of legalization on attitudes, beliefs, and self-reported driving under the influence. Medical legalization, recreational legalization, and decriminalization were associated with increases in positive cannabis tests among drivers. Few studies examined impacts on alcohol or other drug use, although findings suggested a decrease in positive alcohol tests among drivers associated with medical legalization. Medical legalization was associated with reductions in fatal motor-vehicle collisions, whereas recreational legalization was conversely associated with increases in fatal collisions. Discussion Increased cannabis positivity may reflect changes in cannabis use; however, it does not in itself indicate increased impaired driving. Subgroups impacted by medical and recreational legalization, respectively, likely explain opposing findings for fatal collisions. More research is needed concerning cannabis decriminalization; the impacts of decriminalization and legalization on nonfatal injuries, alcohol and other drugs; and the mechanisms by which legalization impacts road safety outcomes."

Study design: National registry-based quasi-experimental study. Methods: We obtained data from the Dutch Perinatal Registry (2010-2020) which was linked to multiple population registries containing sociodemographic variables. A difference-in-discontinuity approach was used to examine the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on various perinatal outcomes. We investigated preterm birth incidence across onset types, alongside other perinatal outcomes including low birth weight, small-for-gestational-age, NICU admission, low-APGAR-score, perinatal mortality, neonatal death, and stillbirths. Results: The analysis of the national-level dataset revealed a consistent pattern of reduced preterm births after the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.96). A drop in spontaneous preterm births post-implementation was observed (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.62-0.98), whereas no change was observed for iatrogenic births. Regarding stillbirths (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.46-1.95) our analysis did not find compelling evidence of substantial changes. For the remaining outcomes, no discernible shifts were observed. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the reduction in preterm births following COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands. No discernible changes were observed for other outcomes, including stillbirths. Our results challenge previous concerns of a potential increase in stillbirths contributing to the drop in preterm births, suggesting alternative mechanisms."

The provision of childcare has the potential to improve women’s mental health, but evidence on the effects of providing access to daycare is limited. Methods We designed a cluster-randomised trial and used data from a sample of 2858 mothers with age-eligible children from 160 village hamlets in rural Rajasthan, India, to evaluate the impact of providing access to a community-based daycare programme on social and emotional aspects of women’s mental health. We conducted a baseline survey in early 2016, randomised hamlets to intervention or control groups approximately six months later, and delivered the final post-intervention survey approximately two years thereafter. Results Treatment assignment increased the probability that a respondent used a daycare over the two-year follow-up by 40.9 percentage points. Providing randomised access to a daycare resulted in 0.2 (95% confidence interval (CI), = ,−0.1, 0.4) fewer symptoms of mental distress, representing a 9.5% decline compared to the baseline mean of 2.1 symptoms, as well as a 3.7 (95% CI, = ,−0.8, 8.3) percentage point increase in the proportion of women who reported feeling very happy, equivalent to an 11.0% increase relative to the baseline mean of 33.6%. Among social indicators, treatment assignment was associated with a 5.6 (95% CI, = ,−1.2, 12.4) percentage point increase in membership in an association, a relative increase of 43.4% compared to the baseline mean of 12.9%. The intervention did not have an appreciable impact on measures of life satisfaction or trust in institutions. Two-stage least squares instrumental variable analyses showed that daycare use decreased mental distress by 0.4 (95% CI, = ,−0.1, 0.8) symptoms, increased the proportion of women who were very happy by 9.4 (95% CI, = ,0.0, 17.6) percentage points, and increased membership in an organisation by 15.9 (95% CI, = ,8.4, 23.7) percentage points. Conclusions The provision of affordable, community-based daycare was associated with substantial uptake and showed potential for improving mothers’ mental health in a rural context where most women were not employed in the formal labour force.

The RCI indicated greater concentration of dengue cases among people living in low socioeconomic settings in both sites. The RCIs for chikungunya in Fortaleza covered the line of equality during their introduction in 2014, while the RCIs for Zika and chikungunya in Medellin indicated the presence of a small inequality. The RCI decomposition showed that year of notification and age were the main contributors to this inequality. In Medellin, the RCI decomposition showed that age and access to waste management accounted for 75.5%, 72.2% and 54.5% of the overall inequality towards the poor for dengue, chikungunya and Zika, respectively.Our study presents estimates of the socioeconomic inequality of arboviruses and its decomposition in two Latin American cities. We corroborate the concentration of arboviral diseases in low socioeconomic neighborhoods and identify that year of occurrence, age, presence of healthcare facilities and waste management are key determinants of the heterogenous distribution of endemic arboviruses across the socioeconomic spectrum."

While α-HPV infection is an established risk factor for head and neck cancers (HNC), the role of other genera remains unclear. We aimed to estimate the effect of α-, β-, γ-HPV on HNC using a hospital-based case-control study. Methods We recruited incident HNC cases (396) and controls (439), frequency-matched by age and sex from four main referral hospitals in Montreal, Canada. We collected information on sociodemographic and behavior characteristics using in-person interviews, and tested rinse, brush and tumor specimens for HPV genotypes. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of HPV on HNC using logistic regression, adjusting for confounding. We conducted probabilistic bias analysis to account for potential exposure misclassification, selection bias, and residual confounding. Results α-HPV genus had a strong effect on HNC, particularly HPV16 (aOR = 22.6; 95% CI: 10.8, 47.2). β-HPV was more common among controls (aOR = 0.80; 95% 0.57, 1.11). After adjustment for HPV16, we found weaker evidence for γ-HPV (aOR = 1.29; 95% CI: 0.80, 2.08). Combined bias analyses for HPV16 increased the strength of the point estimate, but added imprecision (aOR = 54.2, 95%~CI: 10.7, 385.9). Conclusions α-HPV, especially HPV16, appears to increase the risk for HNC, while there is little evidence for an effect of β- or γ-HPV. β-HPV may have a preventive effect, while γ-HPV may increase the risk of HNC, although to a lesser extent than that of α-HPV. Results for cutaneous HPV were imprecise and less conclusive. Due to possible epidemiologic biases, the true relation between HPV and HNC could be underestimated in the literature. Further improvement in current methods and more studies of the biologic mechanisms of the three genera in HNC development are warranted."

Recent reports have shown that genotypes from the beta (β) and gamma (γ) genera, also known as cutaneous HPV, can be found in the oral cavity, but their role is largely unidentified. We investigated the interaction between oral HPV16 and cutaneous HPV in HNC. Methods: We use data on incident HNC cases (n = 384) and frequency-matched hospital-based controls (n = 423) from the HeNCe Life study in Montreal, Canada. Participants were tested for alpha HPV and cutaneous genera using oral mouth rinse and brush samples. We used unconditional logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as a measure of the effect between HPV and HNC and assessed the interaction between HPV genotypes on the multiplicative and additive scales. Results: Prevalence of HPV infection was higher among cases (73%) than controls (63.4%), with cases more likely to be coinfected with more than a single genotype, 52.9% vs. 43.5%, respectively. Infection with HPV16 alone had a strong effect on HNC risk aOR = 18.2 [6.2, 53.2], while infection with any cutaneous HPV, but not HPV16, appeared to have the opposite effect aOR = 0.8 [0.6, 1.1]. The observed effect of joint exposure to HPV16 and any cutaneous HPV (aOR = 20.4 [8.3, 50.1]) was stronger than the expected effect based on an assumption of independent exposures but was measured with considerable imprecision. While the point estimate suggests a positive interaction between HPV16 and cutaneous HPV, results were imprecise with relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) = 2.4 [−23.3, 28.2]. Conclusion: There could be biologic interaction between HPV16 and genotypes from cutaneous genera, which warrants further investigation. Although cutaneous HPVs are not usually found in tumor tissues, they are cofactors that could interact with HPV16 in the oral cavity and thus strengthen the latter’s carcinogenic effect."

Results Average rates of extreme and moderate PTB increased over time but decreased for very PTB. A statistically significant increase in the RII over time was present for extreme and moderate PTB. The adjusted RII for extreme PTB increased from 1.58 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.01) in 1981–1985 to 3.11 (95% CI 2.54 to 3.81) in 2001–2006.

    "text": "Antenatal Steroids and Child Health\n\n\n\nPhoto: Pop Data BC\n\n\n(with Jennifer Hutcheon and Erin Strumpf)\nRATIONALE: Randomized clinical trials have consistently shown that administering antenatal corticosteroids to pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery can reduce neonatal mortality, respiratory morbidity, and other adverse birth outcomes. Yet, use of this proven treatment remains sub-optimal in Canadian clinical practice, with as many as 40% of eligible preterm births at 24-33 weeks’ gestation not receiving antenatal corticosteroids as recommended in Canadian and international practice guidelines.\nOne important factor contributing to low antenatal corticosteroids use is the lack of rigorous data on their longer-term safety for child health. There is no clear evidence of adverse effects, but signals of harm from selected animal and human studies have created concerns that antenatal corticosteroids may impair child neurodevelopment. However, all of these studies are low quality. Follow-up studies of randomized trials were hampered by low follow-up rates and small sample sizes, and observational studies were highly susceptible to confounding. High-quality evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal corticosteroids for child neurodevelopment is critical for optimizing use of this medication.\nWhen randomization is infeasible, regression discontinuity studies can provide evidence on the causal effects of a drug or exposure. The design exploits differences in clinical care among individuals immediately on either side of a clinical or policy cut-point as a pseudo-randomization tool. With antenatal corticosteroids, clinical practice guidelines recommend administration up to 33+6 weeks’ gestation (33 weeks, 6 days) – but not one day later, at 34+0 weeks. This (somewhat) arbitrary cut-off means that infants born as little as hours apart have substantially different chances of receiving this effective treatment. Using preliminary data from over 8500 preterm births in British Columbia, we have shown that regression discontinuity analysis can replicate the clinical trial findings on short-term neonatal respiratory morbidity. We propose to now link our cohort with child development outcomes, and use this novel design to generate rigorous evidence on the longer-term safety of antenatal steroids.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine if antenatal corticosteroid administration decreases kindergarten child development scores (primary outcome) or increases risks of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes such cerebral palsy or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nAPPROACH: We will use a population-based cohort of 12,653 preterm births from British Columbia, Canada, 2000-2013. Obstetrical and neonatal medical records contained in the BC Perinatal Data Registry will be linked with provincial school child development assessments, hospitalization, prescription, and physician visit data. Our primary outcome will be child development scores based on the Early Development Instrument, a validated tool routinely administered by kindergarten teachers across Canada and internationally. International classification of diseases codes and prescriptions will be used to identify our secondary outcomes of cerebral palsy and ADHD. We will use a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of antenatal corticosteroids on outcomes among infants born on either side of the 34+0 weeks’ cut-point within a narrow gestational age window.\nPUBLIC HEALTH IMPORTANCE: Preterm birth is the single most important cause of neonatal mortality and severe morbidity in Canada, and costs the Canadian health care system over $8 billion per year. Antenatal corticosteroids can reduce this burden of disease by 30% for as low as $1 per dose, but the unknown potential for longer-term harm hinders their use in clinical practice. Our findings will inform evidence-based Canadian clinical practice guidelines that address the potential longer-term harms associated with antenatal corticosteroids. This will enable physicians to optimize use of this treatment with proven neonatal benefits that may currently be being avoided unnecessarily.\nFunding: Canadian Institutes for Health Research"

    "text": "Affordable Daycare To Empower Indian Women\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Arijit Nandi\n\n\n(with Arijit Nandi)\nThere are structural barriers to women’s empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable day-care services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable day-care services is a potentially important policy lever for empowering Indian women. Access to day-care might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of day-care programs in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based day-care program on empowerment, economic opportunity, and health among mothers living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the day-care system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth.\nFunding: International Development Research Centre\nThe video below provides some additional details about the project and some essential context for where this work is being done."

Your grade will be based on participation in general class activities, practicums, discussions of readings, and debate. Part of your participation will depend on your preparation. This means showing up for each class having completed the assigned readings; this is especially true for practicum sessions—it is expected that students will begin the practicum assignments, including any readings, in advance of the session. In class, participation means asking questions about anything in the readings, lectures or discussion that seems unclear or objectionable, offering arguments and responses, respectfully listening to the arguments and responses of others, and generally being a good citizen.\n\n\nStudent protocol and presentation: 50% (40% for written protocol and 10% for presentation)\nOver the course of the term students will work in groups of 2-3 students to develop a protocol for a pragmatic intervention study and evaluation. For this project you will work with your group to develop an impact evaluation study designed to estimate the effect of a public policy intervention on a health-related outcome. You should draw on the course material and apply one of the evaluation methods covered. The design of your evaluation should be original, meaning the intervention or the evaluation method must be novel; you cannot replicate an existing impact evaluation (simply changing the outcomes in an existing evaluation study is not sufficient). For the written component of the protocol, each group will submit an evaluation protocol using guidelines that will be provided. Only one submission is allowed per group and we expect partners to contribute equally to the project. Each student will also participate in a short group presentation of their protocol, and will answer questions from their peers and the instructors. Students will be evaluated on their ability to demonstrate mastery of the core conceptual and methodological material presented in class, and on their ability to communicate their ideas and respond to critiques of their work.\n\n\nHomework assignments: 30%\nAdvanced statistical techniques and their assumptions can become clearer with hands-on experience and practice. We aim to provide experience and practice by giving two homework assignments during the term that will involve data analysis and interpretation of results. You can use any software package to complete the assignments. We will provide technical support as best we can. You are allowed to work in groups of up to three, with one submission per group."
