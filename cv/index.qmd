# Research

## Research Activities

My research focuses on investigating how social and environmental factors impact health outcomes and health inequalities. My work is interdisciplinary, combining epidemiological methods with social science approaches to gain insights into the complex interactions between health and society. My research covers a wide variety of topics, but my major areas of focus are:

- (i)	*Methods for measuring health inequalities*. Measuring and monitoring health inequalities are crucial activites for providing evidence on the impact of medical interventions and policies on vulnerable populations, and for testing the plausibility of etiologic factors that may influence social differences in health. My work takes a systematic approach to health inequality measurement and emphasizes the importance that extra-scientific value judgments play in interpreting evidence on the magnitude and trends of health inequalities.

- (ii)	*Analysis of life expectancy trends*. Life expectancy is a fundamental and well-established measure of overall population health. I have made extensive use of demographic techniques for decomposing changes in life expectancy between social groups as a tool for generating evidence on the causes of health inequalities.

- (iii)	*Experimental and quasi-experimental approaches to health inequalities*. I use randomized interventions and plausibly random changes in social and economic policies to estimate the causal effects of exposures on population health and health inequalities. I have used econometric techniques such as difference-in-differences and instrumental variables to estimate the health effects of medical marijuana laws, mandatory seat belt laws, and the Great Recession in the USA, user-fees in sub-Saharan Africa, and tobacco policies in Canada.
